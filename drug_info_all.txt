It is produced via yeast cells. Bayer ceased the production of lepirudin (Refludan) effective May 31, 2012.
1	DB00002	Cetuximab	Metastatic Colorectal Cancers/Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck/Advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck	Cetuximab is an epidermal growth factor receptor binding FAB. Cetuximab is composed of the Fv (variable; antigen-binding) regions of the 225 murine EGFr monoclonal antibody specific for the N-terminal portion of human EGFr with human IgG1 heavy and kappa light chain constant (framework) regions. Cetuximab is marketed under the brand Erbitux® by Eli Lilly and Company. In the United States, a regimen of cetuximab costs approximately $30,790 for an eight-week course.
2	DB00003	Dornase alfa	Cystic Fibrosis (CF)	Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human deoxyribunuclease I (DNase I) enzyme. It is produced in genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. The 260-amino acid sequence of dornase alfa is identical to the endogenous human enzyme. Dornase alfa cleaves extracellular DNA to 5´-phosphodinucleotide and 5´-phosphooligonucleotide end products without affecting intracellular DNA. In individuals with cystic fibrosis, extracellular DNA, which is an extremely viscous anion, is released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate during inflammatory responses to infections. Enzymatic breakdown of this extracellular DNA appears to reduce sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity.

Leuprolide is also under investigation for possible use in the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
7	DB00008	Peginterferon alfa-2a	Hepatitis B Chronic Infection/Compensated liver disease	"Peginterferon alfa-2a is a form of recombinant interferon used as part of combination therapy to treat chronic Hepatitis C, an infectious liver disease caused by infection with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV). HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients . Treatment options for chronic Hepatitis C have advanced significantly since 2011, with the development of Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) resulting in less use of Peginterferon alfa-2a. Peginterferon alfa-2a is derived from the alfa-2a moeity of recombinant human interferon and acts by binding to human type 1 interferon receptors. Activation and dimerization of this receptor induces the body's innate antiviral response by activating the janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway. Use of Peginterferon alfa-2a is associated with a wide range of severe adverse effects including the aggravation and development of endocrine and autoimmune disorders, retinopathies, cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric complications, and increased risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis. The use of Peginterferon alfa-2a has largely declined since newer interferon-free antiviral therapies have been developed.
In a joint recommendation published in 2016, the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) no longer recommend Peginterferon alfa-2a for the treatment of Hepatitis C . Peginterferon alfa-2a was used alongside DB00811 with the intent to cure, or achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), after 48 weeks of therapy. SVR and eradication of HCV infection is associated with significant long-term health benefits including reduced liver-related damage, improved quality of life, reduced incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and reduced all-cause mortality .
Peginterferon alfa-2a is available as a fixed dose injector (tradename Pegasys) used for the treatment of chronic Hepatitis C. Approved in 2002 by the FDA, Pegasys is indicated for the treatment of HCV with DB00811 or other antiviral drugs [FDA Label]. When combined together, Peginterferon alfa-2a and DB00811 have been shown to achieve a SVR between 36% for genotype 1 and 59% for genotypes 2-6 after 48 weeks of treatment."

21	DB00023	Asparaginase Escherichia coli	Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemias (ALL)	Asparaginase derived from Escherichia coli (L-asparagine amidohydrolase, EC 3.5.1.1) is an enzyme responsible for the metabolism of L-asparagine, by catalyzing L-asparagine into L-aspartic acid and ammonia. It also facilitates the production of oxaloacetate which is needed for general cellular metabolism. Asparaginase from E. coli has clinically shown to exhibit antitumor actions in models of leukaemias [A31996, A31997]. L-asparaginase of E. coli is marketed under several different trade names, including Elspar, for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as part of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen. It is available as intramuscular or intravenous injections. Therapeutic L-asparaginase from E. coli works by depleting the levels of non-essential amino acid, asparagine, in lymphoblastic leukemic cells thus promoting apoptotic cell death . For patients who develop hypersensitivity to E. coli-derived formulations of L-asparaginase, the use of PEGylated or non-PEGylated DB08886 is recommended .
22	DB00024	Thyrotropin alfa	Thyroid Cancers/Thyroid tissue remnants/Radioiodine ablation of thyroid tissue	Thyrotropin alfa is a recombinant form of thyroid stimulating hormone used in performing certain tests in patients who have or have had thyroid cancer. It is also used along with a radioactive agent to destroy remaining thyroid tissue in certain patients who have had their thyroid gland removed because of thyroid cancer. It is a heterodimeric glycoprotein comprised of two non-covalently linked subunits, an alpha subunit of 92 amino acid residues containing two N-linked glycosylation sites and a beta subunit of 112 residues containing one N-linked glycosylation site. The alpha subunit of thyrotropin alfa, which is the effector region responsible for the stimulation of adenylate cyclase, displays close structural similarity with the alpha subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The beta subunit (TSHB) bestows its receptor specificity due to the uniqueness to TSH. The amino acid sequence of thyrotropin alfa is identical to that of human pituitary thyroid stimulating hormone.

28	DB00030	Insulin human	Diabetes Mellitus (DM)	"Human Insulin, also known as Regular Insulin, is a short-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Human insulin is produced by recombinant DNA technology and is identical to endogenously produced insulin. Typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus, insulin is a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.
Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as DB00331, DB01120, or DB01261 have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 
Marketed as the brand name product Humulin R or Novolin R, human insulin begins to exert its effects within 30 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 3-4 hours after administration. Due to its quick onset of action, human insulin is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as DB01307, DB09564, and DB00047 to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.
Human insulin is also available in an inhalable form, intended to be used as a bolus meal-time insulin. Exubera was the first inhaled insulin available on the market and was developed by Inhale Therapeutics (later named Nektar Therapeutics). Unfortunately, limited uptake by physicians and patients, poor sales, bulky packaging, and concerns over the possible impact on lung cancer development resulted in Exubera products being withdrawn from the US markets . Exubera was followed by Afrezza, a monomeric inhaled insulin developed by Mannkind Corporation, which received FDA approval in 2016. While still available in the US, Afrezza has had similar concerns associated with its use, and had an FDA ""black box"" warning added to it to warn about use in patients with chronic lung disease. Afrezza does not currently have Health Canada or European Medicines Agency approval for marketing in Canada or the EU. 
Human Insulin is a 51 residue peptide hormone produced by recombinant DNA technology by inserting the human insulin gene into Escherichia coli bacteria or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The structure is identical to native human insulin, with two amino acid chains covalently linked by disulfide bonds. 
Human insulin is also available in an intermediate-acting form as NPH (Neutral Protamine Hagedorn) as the marketed products Novolin N and Humulin N. NPH insulin is provided as a crystalline suspension of insulin with protamine and zinc, resulting in an onset of action in 1 to 3 hours, duration of action up to 24 hours, and peak action from 6 to 8 hours. Due to the added crystals, NPH insulin is typically cloudy when compared to other forms of insulin and has a neutral pH.
Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy."

33	DB00035	Desmopressin	Bleeding/Central Diabetes Insipidus/Nocturia/Polydipsia/Polyuria/Primary Nocturnal Enuresis	"Desmopressin (dDAVP), a synthetic analogue of 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), is an antidiuretic peptide drug modified by deamination of 1-cysteine and substitution of 8-L-arginine by 8-D-arginine. ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney . The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.
Desmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH . It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate . Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate.

43	DB00046	Insulin Lispro	Diabetes Mellitus (DM)/Diabetic Ketoacidosis/Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)/Hyperglycemias	"Insulin lispro is a rapid-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.
Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin lispro, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after several oral medications such as DB00331, DB01120, or DB01261 have been tried, and when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 
Marketed as the brand name product Humalog, insulin lispro begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, Humalog is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as DB01307, DB09564, or DB00047 to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.
Insulin lispro is produced by recombinant DNA technology utilizing a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli and was the first commercially available insulin analog. Formerly called LYSPRO from the chemical nomenclature [LYS(B28), PRO(B29)], insulin lispro differs from human insulin in that the amino acid proline at position B28 is replaced by lysine and the lysine in position B29 is replaced by proline. These biochemical changes result in a reduced tendency for self-association resulting in dissolution to a dimer and then to a monomer that is absorbed more rapidly after subcutaneous injection compared to endogenous human insulin. 
Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy."
44	DB00047	Insulin glargine	Diabetes Mellitus (DM)/Hyperglycemias/Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	"Insulin glargine is a long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.

Available as the brand name product Lantus, insulin glargine has a duration of action up to 24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. Due to its duration of action, Lantus is considered ""basal insulin"" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting ""bolus insulin"" such as DB00046, DB01309, and DB01306 to provide higher doses of insulin that are required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia. 
Insulin glargine is also available as the biosimilar, or ""follow-on"" product, Basaglar in the US and as Abasaglar in the EU. As of 2015, insulin glargine was reformulated by Sanofi as the product Toujeo in an extra-concentrated form containing 300IU/mL (compared to 100IU/mL contained in Lantus). Use of the higher concentrated Toujeo as compared to Lantus results in slightly different pharmacokinetics, with a later onset (up to 6 hours) and duration of action (up to 30 hours). 
Insulin glargine is produced by recombinant DNA technology using a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12) as the production organism. Insulin glargine differs from endogenous human insulin by the replacement of an asparagine residue at position A21 of the A-chain with glycine and addition of two arginines to the C-terminus (positions B31 and 32) of the B-chain. The resulting protein is soluble at pH 4 and forms microprecipitates at physiological pH 7.4 allowing for the slow release of small amounts of insulin glargine, giving the drug a long duration of action and no pronounced peak concentration.
Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency.

61	DB00065	Infliximab	Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/Crohn's Disease (CD)/Psoriasis Vulgaris (Plaque Psoriasis)/Psoriatic Arthritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis/Ulcerative Colitis (UC)	"Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha or TNF-α) blocker and a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody composed of human constant (75%) and murine variable (25%) regions . Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by continuous perfusion. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) is a key proinflammatory cytokine involved in chronic inflammatory diseases . Its hyperactivity and enhanced signalling pathways can be observed in inflammatory diseases where it activates further pro-inflammatory cascades. By binding to both the soluble subunit and the membrane-bound precursor of TNF-α , infliximab disrupts the interaction of TNF-α with its receptors and may also cause lysis of cells that produce TNF-α .
Infliximab was first approved by the FDA in 1998 under the market name Remicade as an intravenous injection. It is indicated for the treatment of various inflammatory disorders such as adult or pediatric Chron's disease, adult or pediatric ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis in combination with methotrexate, ankylosing spondyliti, psoriatic arthritis, and plaque psoriasis [FDA Label]. In clinical trials, multiple infusions of infliximab displayed in a reduction of signs and symptoms of inflammatory diseases and induction of remission in patients who have had an inadequate response to alternative first-line therapies for that disorder [FDA Label]. 
There are currently two biosilimars of infliximab available in the US market that demonstrate a high degree of similarity to the reference product, Remicade. They are approved for all eligible indications of the reference product. Inflectra, a first biosimilar drug product, was approved in 2016. In December 2017, Ixifi, a second biosimilar that was developed by Pfizer, was granted approval by the FDA."
62	DB00066	Follitropin	Assisted Reproductive Technology therapy/Ovulation induction therapy/Stimulation of spermatogenesis therapy	Follitropin is a human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) preparation of recombinant DNA origin, which consists of two non-covalently linked, non-identical glycoproteins designated as the alpha- and beta- subunits. The alpha- and beta- subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids. The alpha subunit is glycosylated at Asn 51 and Asn 78 while the beta subunit is glycosylated at Asn 7 and Asn 24. Follitropin beta is produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster cell lines (CHO). The nomenclature “beta” differentiates it from another recombinant human FSH product that was marketed earlier as follitropin alpha. Follitropin is important in the development of follicles produced by the ovaries. Given by subcutaneous injection, it is used in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to assist in ovulation and fertility. Follitropin may also be used to cause the ovary to produce several follicles, which can then be harvested for use in gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) or in vitro fertilization (IVF).  Numerous physio-chemical tests and bioassays indicate that follitropin beta and follitropin alpha are indistinguishable. However, a more recent study showed there is may be a slight clinical difference, with the alpha form tending towards a higher pregnancy rate and the beta form tending towards a lower pregnancy rate, but with significantly higher estradiol (E2) levels. Structural analysis shows that the amino acid sequence of follitropin beta is identical to that of natural human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). Further, the ogliosaccharide side chains are very similar, but not completely identical to that of natural FSH. However, these small differences do not affect the bioactivity compared to natural FSH.

65	DB00069	Interferon alfacon-1		Interferon alfacon-1 is a recombinant non-naturally occurring type-I interferon. The 166-amino acid sequence of Interferon alfacon-1 was derived by scanning the sequences of several natural interferon alpha subtypes and assigning the most frequently observed amino acid in each corresponding position. Four additional amino acid changes were made to facilitate the molecular construction, and a corresponding synthetic DNA sequence was constructed using chemical synthesis methodology. Interferon alfacon-1 differs from interferon alfa-2b at 20/166 amino acids (88% homology), and comparison with interferon-beta shows identity at over 30% of the amino acid positions. Interferon alfacon-1 is produced in Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells that have been genetically altered by insertion of a synthetically constructed sequence that codes for Interferon alfacon-1. Prior to final purification, Interferon alfacon-1 is allowed to oxidize to its native state, and its final purity is achieved by sequential passage over a series of chromatography columns.

It is used as a treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2+ metastatic breast cancer, where there is a proven amplification of the HER-2 oncogene or over-expression of the HER-2 protein in tumours. It is suggested that the overexpression or gene amplification of HER2 has been found in about 20–30% of breast cancers and elevated activation of HER2 triggers multiple downstream pathways leading to abnormal proliferation of cancer cells . Trastuzumab binds to HER2 and suppresses cancer cells growth, proliferation, and survival directly and indirectly .
In December 2017, FDA approved Ogivri (trastuzumab-dkst) as a biosimilar to Herceptin (trastuzumab) for the treatment of patients with breast or metastatic stomach cancer (gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma) whose tumors overexpress the HER2 gene (HER2+). It displays biosimilar properties as Herceptin according to clinical data. While Ogivri is the first biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of breast cancer or stomach cancer, it is the second biosimilar approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cancer. Herzuma (trastuzumab-pkrb) is a biosimilar drug approved in December 2018 for the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.

Renal production of calcitriol is stimulated in response to PTH, low calcium and low phosphate . Calcitriol plays a role in plasma calcium regulation in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) by enhancing absorption of dietary calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract, promoting renal tubular reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys, and stimulating the release of calcium stores from the skeletal system. In addition to promoting fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting lipolysis, calcitriol has been demonstrated to increase energy efficiency by suppressing UCP2 expression, which is modulated by signaling pathways of classical nuclear receptors (nVDR), where calcitriol acts as a natural ligand . There is also evidence that calcitriol modulates the action of cytokines and may regulate immune and inflammatory response, cell turnover, cell differentiation . 
Administered orally and intravenously, calcitriol is commonly used as a medication in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone disease, hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis, and osteoporosis. It is also available in topical form for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis in adults.

143	DB00153	Ergocalciferol	Hypophosphatemia, Familial/Vitamin D Resistant Rickets/Parathyroid deficiency/Dietary and Nutritional Therapies	Ergocalciferol is an inactivated vitamin D analog. It is a form of vitamin synthesized by some plants in the presence of UVB light. The production of ergocalciferol was impulsed by the identification of dietary deficiency, more specifically vitamin D, as the main causative agent for rickets. Impulsed by this research, ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932. Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and it differentiates from cholecalciferol in the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol to vitamin D binding protein which derives in faster clearance, limits its activation and alters its catabolism. The first approved product containing ergocalciferol under the FDA records was developed by US Pharm Holdings and FDA approved in 1941.

It forms NADP with the addition of a phosphate group to the 2' position of the adenosyl nucleotide through an ester linkage. (Dorland, 27th ed)
148	DB00158	Folic acid	Neural Tube Defects (NTDs)/Methotrexate toxicity	"Folic acid, also known as folate or Vitamin B9, is a member of the B vitamin family and an essential cofactor for enzymes involved in DNA and RNA synthesis. More specifically, folic acid is required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. Folic acid is particularly important during phases of rapid cell division, such as infancy, pregnancy, and erythropoiesis, and plays a protective factor in the development of cancer. As humans are unable to synthesize folic acid endogenously, diet and supplementation is necessary to prevent deficiencies. For example, folic acid is present in green vegetables, beans, avocado, and some fruits. In order to function within the body, folic acid must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted by anti-metabolite therapies such as DB00563 as they function as DHFR inhibitors to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, and therefore prevent the formation of DHF and THF. When used in high doses such as for cancer therapy, or in low doses such as for Rheumatoid Arthritis or psoriasis, DB00563 impedes the body's ability to create folic acid. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects. As a result, supplementation with 1-5mg of folic acid is recommended to prevent deficiency and a number of side effects associated with MTX therapy including mouth ulcers and gastrointestinal irritation. DB00650 (also known as folinic acid) supplementation is typically used for high-dose MTX regimens for the treatment of cancer. Levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF) and are able to bypass DHFR reduction to act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF.
There are also several antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) that are associated with reduced serum and red blood cell folate, including DB00564 (CBZ), DB00252 (PHT), or barbiturates. Folic acid is therefore often provided as supplementation to individuals using these medications, particularly to women of child-bearing age. 
Inadequate folate levels can result in a number of health concerns including cardiovascular disease, megaloblastic anemias, cognitive deficiencies, and neural tube defects (NTDs). Folic acid is typically supplemented during pregnancy to prevent the development of NTDs and in individuals with alcoholism to prevent the development of neurological disorders, for example."

A diet rich in eicosapentaenoic acid lowers serum lipid concentration, reduces incidence of cardiovascular disorders, prevents platelet aggregation, and inhibits arachidonic acid conversion into the thromboxane-2 and prostaglandin-2 families.
150	DB00160	L-Alanine		A non-essential amino acid that occurs in high levels in its free state in plasma. It is produced from pyruvate by transamination. It is involved in sugar and acid metabolism, increases immunity, and provides energy for muscle tissue, brain, and the central nervous system.
151	DB00161	L-Valine		A branched-chain essential amino acid that has stimulant activity. It promotes muscle growth and tissue repair. It is a precursor in the penicillin biosynthetic pathway. [PubChem]
152	DB00162	Vitamin A		Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response. Dietary vitamin A is derived from a variety of carotenoids found in plants. It is enriched in the liver, egg yolks, and the fat component of dairy products.
153	DB00163	Vitamin E		In 1922, vitamin E was demonstrated to be an essential nutrient . Vitamin E is a term used to describe 8 different fat soluble tocopherols and tocotrienols, alpha-tocopherol being the most biologically active . Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage . The antioxidant effects are currently being researched for use in the treatment of diseases causing bone loss, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities, eye diseases, inflammatory diseases (including skin conditions), lipid disorders, neurological diseases, and radiation damage . Though this research is so far inconclusive, vitamin E remains a popular supplement and is generally considered safe by the FDA[FDA Label].
154	DB00165	Pyridoxine		"Pyridoxine is the 4-methanol form of vitamin B6, an important water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. As its classification as a vitamin implies, Vitamin B6 (and pyridoxine) are essential nutrients required for normal functioning of many biological systems within the body. While many plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize pyridoxine through endogenous biological processes, animals must obtain it through their diet. 
More specifically, pyridoxine is converted to pyridoxal 5-phosphate in the body, which is an important coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid. It's important to note that Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. Although all six of these compounds should technically be referred to as vitamin B6, the term vitamin B6 is commonly used interchangeably with just one of them, pyridoxine . 
Vitamin B6, principally in its biologically active coenzyme form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) . 
Pyridoxine is used medically for the treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency and for the prophylaxis of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy (due to DB00951's mechanism of action which competitively inhibits the action of pyridoxine in the above-mentioned metabolic functions). It is also used in combination with DB00366 (as the commercially available product Diclectin) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy."
155	DB00166	Lipoic acid		A vitamin-like antioxidant.
156	DB00167	Isoleucine		An essential branched-chain aliphatic amino acid found in many proteins. It is an isomer of leucine. It is important in hemoglobin synthesis and regulation of blood sugar and energy levels.

158	DB00169	Vitamin D3	Hypophosphatemia, Familial/Vitamin D Resistant Rickets/Parathyroid deficiency	"Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight . Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake . Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 . Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use .
Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048]. However, studies are also ongoing to determine whether or not cholecalciferol may also play certain roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other medical conditions that may be associated with vitamin D deficiency ."

Pravastatin was firstly approved in 1991 becoming the second available statin in the United States. It was the first statin administered as the active form and not as a prodrug. This drug was developed by Sankyo Co. Ltd.; however, the first approved pravastatin product was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and FDA approved in 1991. Pravastatin is made through a fermentation process in which mevastatin is first obtained. The manufacturing process is followed by the hydrolysis of the lactone group and the biological hydroxylation with Streptomyces carbophilus to introduce the allylic 6-alcohol group.
165	DB00176	Fluvoxamine	Bulimia Nervosa (BN)/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)	"Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant which functions pharmacologically as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Though it is in the same class as other SSRI drugs, it is most often used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Fluvoxamine has been in use in clinical practice since 1983 and has a clinical trial database comprised of approximately 35,000 patients. It was launched in the US in December 1994 and in Japan in June 1999. As of the end of 1995, more than 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with fluvoxamine."
166	DB00177	Valsartan	Cardiovascular Mortality/Diabetic Nephropathies/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Moderate Essential Hypertension/Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA Class II)/Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA Class III)/Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA Class IV)/Hospitalization due to cardiac failure/Symptomatic left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 35% Chronic heart failure	"Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes telmisartan, candesartan, losartan, olmesartan, and irbesartan. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 
Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling. By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as ramipril, lisinopril, and perindopril) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 
Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]
Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States. Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]"
167	DB00178	Ramipril	Diabetic Nephropathies/Heart Failure/Heart Failure With Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Myocardial Infarction/Nondiabetic proteinuric chronic kidney disease/Strokes/High risk cardiovascular event	Ramipril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is metabolized to ramiprilat in the liver and, to a lesser extent, kidneys. Ramiprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Ramipril may be used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, nephropathy, and to reduce the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events.
168	DB00179	Masoprocol		A potent lipoxygenase inhibitor that interferes with arachidonic acid metabolism. The compound also inhibits formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase, carboxylesterase, and cyclooxygenase to a lesser extent. It also serves as an antioxidant in fats and oils. [PubChem]

This drug was initially approved by the FDA in 1992 . It is available in tablet form [FDA label], injection form , and powder form (for suspension) ."
171	DB00182	Amphetamine	Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)/BMI >30 kg/m2/Depression/Narcolepsy/Pain, Chronic	Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers. The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976. During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.
172	DB00183	Pentagastrin	C-cell hyperplasia/Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC)	A synthetic pentapeptide that mimics the actions of endogenous gastrin when given parenterally. It works by stimulating the secretion of gastric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor. It has also been used as a diagnostic aid.
173	DB00184	Nicotine	Dental Cavity/Nicotine Withdrawal	Nicotine is highly toxic alkaloid. It is the prototypical agonist at nicotinic cholinergic receptors where it dramatically stimulates neurons and ultimately blocks synaptic transmission. Nicotine is also important medically because of its presence in tobacco smoke.
174	DB00185	Cevimeline	Dry Mouth	Cevimeline is a parasympathomimetic agent that act as an agonist at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M1 and M3. It is indicated by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of dry mouth associated with Sjögren's syndrome.

It was developed by DJ Richards, presented and marketed initially by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the USA in 1977. The first historic FDA label approval is reported in 1985 by the company Mutual Pharm.
176	DB00187	Esmolol	Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia, Supraventricular/Intraoperative Hypertension/Intraoperative Tachycardia/Noncompensatory Sinus tachycardia/Postoperative Hypertension/Postoperative Tachycardia	Esmolol, commonly marketed under the trade name Brevibloc, is a cardioselective beta-1 receptor blocker. It has a rapid onset but short duration of action without causing significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activities at recommended therapeutic doses. It works by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which leads to decreased force and rate of heart contractions. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine.
177	DB00188	Bortezomib	Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)/Multiple Myeloma (MM)	Bortezomib (originally PS-341 and marketed as Velcade by Millennium Pharmaceuticals) is the first therapeutic proteasome inhibitor to be tested in humans. The boron atom within bortezomib catalytically binds the active site of the 26S proteasome with high affinity and specificity, thereby resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In normal cells, the proteasome is involved in degradation of ubiquitylated proteins that have been tagged for destruction because they are damaged or unneeded by the cell. However, in cancerous cells, proteasome activity degrades pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53 that would normally result in programmed cell death of the dysfunctional cells. Proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib interrupt this process, resulting in destruction of cancerous cells. Bortezomib is currently approved in the United States for the treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.
178	DB00189	Ethchlorvynol		Ethchlorvynol is a sedative and hypnotic drug. It has been used to treat insomnia, but has been largely superseded and is only offered where an intolerance or allergy to other drugs exists.
179	DB00190	Carbidopa	Parkinson's Disease (PD)/Postencephalitic parkinsonism/Symptomatic Parkinson Disease/Levodopa-driven nausea and vomiting	Carbidopa presents a chemical denomination of N-amino-alpha-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. It potently inhibits aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and due to its chemical properties, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Due to its activity, carbidopa is always administered concomitantly with levodopa. An individual formulation containing solely carbidopa was generated to treat nausea in patients where the combination therapy levodopa/carbidopa is not efficient reducing nausea. The first approved product by the FDA containing only carbidopa was developed by Amerigens Pharmaceuticals Ltd and approved on 2014. On the other hand, the combination treatment of carbidopa/levodopa was originally developed by Watson Labs but the historical information by the FDA brings back to the approval of this combination therapy developed by Mayne Pharma in 1992.
180	DB00191	Phentermine	BMI >30 kg/m2	Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic agent and it was introduced in 1959 as part of an anti-obesity combination drug.[A174361, A174364] It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine. Phentermine has not been reported an addictive potential which allows this agent to be classified under the Schedule IV drugs (low abuse potential). Phentermine was FDA approved for short-term weight management in 1959 and it became widely used in 1960. This initial product, formed by the combination of phentermine with fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine was discontinued after finding several reports of abnormal valves in nearly 30% of the consumers.[A174376, T403] Later on, phentermine was approved alone and in combination with topiramate in 2012 as a new alternative that required lower doses of phentermine to obtain the desired effect.
181	DB00192	Indecainide		Indecainide is a rarely used antidysrhythmic. Indecainide has local anesthetic activity and belongs to the membrane stabilizing (Class 1) group of antiarrhythmic agents; it has electrophysiologic effects characteristic of the IC class of antiarrhythmics.
182	DB00193	Tramadol	Pain, Acute/Premature Ejaculation/Severe Pain/Moderate Pain	"Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to codeine and morphine. Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of morphine. 
Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways. Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as duloxetine and venlafaxine.
Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] 
Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain. Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]"
183	DB00194	Vidarabine		A nucleoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces antibioticus. It has some antineoplastic properties and has broad spectrum activity against DNA viruses in cell cultures and significant antiviral activity against infections caused by a variety of viruses such as the herpes viruses, the vaccinia VIRUS and varicella zoster virus.

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1990. This drug is an azole antifungal, in the same drug family as ketoconazole and itraconazole. Fluconazole has many advantages over the other antifungal drugs including the option of oral administration. The side effect profile of this drug is minimal. It has been demonstrated as an efficacious treatment for vaginal yeast infections in one single dose.
186	DB00197	Troglitazone		Troglitazone was withdrawn in 2000 due to risk of hepatotoxicity. It was superseded by pioglitazone and rosiglitazone.
187	DB00198	Oseltamivir	Influenza A Virus Infection/Influenza A, Influenza B/Influenza B	"Oseltamivir (also known as the marketed product TamifluⓇ), is an antiviral neuraminidase inhibitor used for the treatment and prophylaxis of infection with influenza viruses A (including pandemic H1N1) and B. Oseltamivir exerts its antiviral activity by inhibiting the activity of the viral neuraminidase enzyme found on the surface of the virus, which prevents budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.
The clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir is greatest when administered within 48 hours of the onset of influenza symptoms since effectiveness decreases significantly after that point in time; there is generally no benefit in use beyond 48 hours for healthy, low-risk individuals as influenza is a self-limiting illness.[A180574, L7267, A180580] However, antiviral treatment might be beneficial when initiated after 48 hours for patients with severe, complicated or progressive illness or for hospitalized patients. According to the CDC, data from clinical trials and observational studies have demonstrated that early antiviral treatment can shorten the duration of fever and illness symptoms, and may reduce the risk of some complications (including pneumonia and respiratory failure). They recommend the use of oseltamivir in people with a higher risk of developing complications including children younger than 2 years, people over 65 years, people with some chronic conditions or immunosuppression, pregnant women, residents of long term care facilities, and indigenous communities for example. The benefits of oseltamivir use are controversial; a 2014 Cochrane Review of the evidence found that oseltamivir treatment had limited benefit. The authors concluded that oseltamivir use in healthy adults had small, non-specific effects on symptoms (where the time to first alleviation of symptoms was only reduced from 7 to 6.3 days), it had no effect on hospitalizations, and that there was no evidence for any reductions in complications of influenza such as pneumonia.[A179962, A179965, A179968] Due to the risk of adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, psychiatric effects and renal adverse events in adults and vomiting in children, the harms are generally considered to outweigh the small clinical benefit of use of oseltamivir. 
Notably, in 2017, the World Health Organization downgraded oseltamivir from its essential medicines list from a ""core"" drug to a ""complementary"" drug, due to limited cost-effectiveness. Yearly vaccination with the influenza vaccine is still considered the best preventative measure."

It was originally discovered in 1952. Erythromycin is widely used for treating a variety of infections, including those caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.[L5245,L7261] It is available for administration in various forms, including intravenous, topical, and eye drop preparations.
189	DB00200	Hydroxocobalamin	Anemia, Pernicious/Toxic effect of hydrocyanic acid and cyanides/Vitamin B12 Deficiency	Hydroxocobalamin, also known as vitamin B12a and hydroxycobalamin, is an injectable form of vitamin B 12 that has been used therapeutically to treat vitamin B 12 deficiency. It is also used in cyanide poisoning, Leber's optic atrophy, and toxic amblyopia.
190	DB00201	Caffeine	Primary apnea of premature newborns/Tiredness/Moderate Pain	A methylxanthine naturally occurring in some beverages and also used as a pharmacological agent. Caffeine's most notable pharmacological effect is as a central nervous system stimulant, increasing alertness and producing agitation. It also relaxes smooth muscle, stimulates cardiac muscle, stimulates diuresis, and appears to be useful in the treatment of some types of headache. Several cellular actions of caffeine have been observed, but it is not entirely clear how each contributes to its pharmacological profile. Among the most important are inhibition of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, antagonism of adenosine receptors, and modulation of intracellular calcium handling.
191	DB00202	Succinylcholine		A quaternary skeletal muscle relaxant usually used in the form of its bromide, chloride, or iodide. It is a depolarizing relaxant, acting in about 30 seconds and with a duration of effect averaging three to five minutes. Succinylcholine is used in surgical, anesthetic, and other procedures in which a brief period of muscle relaxation is called for.
192	DB00203	Sildenafil	Erectile Dysfunction (ED)/NYHA Functional Class II-III Pulmonary arterial hypertension	"In eliciting its mechanism of action, sildenafil ultimately prevents or minimizes the breakdown of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) by inhibiting cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614]. The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].
Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s . Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].
Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 , continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer's brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries ."

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1991 .
It is primarily used for the treatment of respiratory, enteric and genitourinary infections and may be used instead of other macrolides for some sexually transmitted and enteric infections. It is structurally related to erythromycin .
Azithromycin [9-deoxo-9a-aza-9a-methyl-9a-homoerythromycin] is a part of the azalide subclass of macrolides, and contains a 15-membered ring, with a methyl-substituted nitrogen instead of a carbonyl group at the 9a position on the aglycone ring, which allows for the prevention of its metabolism. This differentiates azithromycin from other types of macrolides ."
197	DB00208	Ticlopidine	Stent Thrombosis/Strokes	Ticlopidine is an effective inhibitor of platelet aggregation. It is a prodrug that is metabolised to an active form, which blocks the ADP receptor that is involved in GPIIb/IIIa receptor activation leading to platelet aggregation. Ticlopidine is marketed under the brand name Ticlid and is indicated for patients who cannot take aspirin or in whom aspirin has not worked to prevent a thrombotic stroke. The FDA label includes a black-box warning of neutropenia, aplastic anemia, thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura, and agranulocytosis, so it is necessary to monitor patients' WBC and platelets when they are taking ticlopidine.
198	DB00209	Trospium	Urinary Bladder, Overactive	Trospium is an antispasmodic agent used to treat the symptoms of overactive bladder, a condition that causes the bladder muscles to contract uncontrollably. An overactive bladder leads to an increased urge to urinate, frequent urination, and sometimes, loss of control over urination. Trospium is manufactured by Indevus Pharmaceutical Inc. and was granted FDA approval in 2007.

202	DB00213	Pantoprazole	Bacterial Infection Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori)/Erosive Esophagitis(EE)/GERD With Erosive Esophagitis/Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)/Healing/Stress Ulcers/Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome/Conditions where a reduction of gastric acid secretion is required/Pathological hypersecretory conditions	"Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of H. pylori infections along with other antibiotics including DB01060, DB01211, and DB00916, for example.  Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including DB00338, DB00736, DB00448, DB05351, and DB01129.
Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]
Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal C. difficile), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life. PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]
Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion."

211	DB00222	Glimepiride	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	"First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present , as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake . 
Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (KATP channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to glipizide, another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs . Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes . It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus . Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily."

216	DB00227	Lovastatin	Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)/Dyslipidemias/Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia/High Cholesterol/Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)/Primary prevention Coronary artery disease/Primary prevention Myocardial infarction/Primary prevention Unstable angina	"Lovastatin, also known as the brand name product Mevacor, is a lipid-lowering drug and fungal metabolite derived synthetically from a fermentation product of Aspergillus terreus. Originally named Mevinolin, lovastatin belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]
Lovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, and simvastatin are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world. Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with &lt;10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]
While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as pravastatin and rosuvastatin which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]"
217	DB00228	Enflurane		An extremely stable inhalation anesthetic that allows rapid adjustments of anesthesia depth with little change in pulse or respiratory rate.
218	DB00229	Cefotiam		One of the cephalosporins that has a broad spectrum of activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.
219	DB00230	Pregabalin	Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPN)/Fibromyalgia/Pain, Neuropathic/Postherpetic Neuralgia/Partial onset seizure Epilepsy	Pregabalin is structurally similar to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) - an inhibitory neurotransmitter. It may be used to manage neuropathic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, and fibromyalgia among other conditions. Although as per the FDA Label the mechanism of action has not been definitively defined, there is evidence that pregabalin exerts its effects by binding to the α2δ subunit of voltage-dependent calcium channels.  Pregabalin is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Lyrica and Lyrica Cr (extended release).  It may have dependence liability if misused but the risk appears to be highest in patients with current or past substance use disorders.
220	DB00231	Temazepam	Sleeplessness	"Temazepam, like many other similar and related benzodiazepines, acts as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulator and is capable of eliciting a variety of actions including sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action [A175207, A175210, F3718, F3721].
Although the chemical synthesis of temazepam was established by 1965 , mainstream contemporary use of the medication did not occur until it's legitimate use as treatment for insomnia was accepted and approved later on. In particular, before temazepam saw regular prescription use in civilians it was - and still is - employed by the US military as a sedative-hypnotic medication to be taken by soldiers, pilots, etc. to obtain the necessary rest required for medical recovery or scheduled maneuvers and operations . Regardless, temazepam has become one of the most frequently prescribed medications internationally and sees millions of prescriptions every year. Unfortunately, however, given its frequent use and the inherent nature of its pharmacological effects, temazepam - like many other benzodiazepines - possesses a high potential for misuse and is genuinely capable of developing drug tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction in users."
221	DB00232	Methyclothiazide	High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Oedema	A thiazide diuretic with properties similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p825)

Reboxetine has two chiral centers, but it only exists as two enantiomers, (R,R)-(-)- and (S,S)-(+)-reboxetine.
224	DB00235	Milrinone	Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)	A positive inotropic cardiotonic agent with vasodilator properties. It inhibits cAMP phosphodiesterase activity in myocardium and vascular smooth muscle. Milrinone is a derivative of amrinone and has 20-30 times the ionotropic potency of amrinone.
225	DB00236	Pipobroman		An antineoplastic agent that acts by alkylation.
226	DB00237	Butabarbital	Sleeplessness	Butabarbital (trade name Butisol) is a barbiturate with a particularly fast onset of effects and short duration of action compared to other barbiturates. This makes butabarbital a useful drug for certain applications such as treating severe insomnia and relieving anxiety before surgical procedures. However, like other barbiturate drugs, butabarbital is associated with profound CNS depressant effects, especially when combined with alcohol, as well as the risk of drug misuse and dependence. While its clinical use is typically limited, it is still prescribed in some Eastern European and South American countries. Its short duration of action gives butabarbital a high abuse potential, comparable to secobarbital.
227	DB00238	Nevirapine	Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)	A potent, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in combination with nucleoside analogues for treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infection and AIDS. [PubChem] Structurally, nevirapine belongs to the dipyridodiazepinone chemical class.
228	DB00239	Oxiconazole	Fungal infection of the dermal/Pityriasis versicolor/Tinea Corporis/Tinea Cruris/Tinea Pedis	Oxiconazole is an antifungal agent that is commonly found in topical formulations. It is marketed under the brand names Oxistat and Oxistat, and is used in the treatment of various skin infections such as athlete's foot, jock itch and ringworm.
229	DB00240	Alclometasone	Dermatosis	Alclometasone is synthetic glucocorticoid steroid for topical use in dermatology as anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, antiallergic, antiproliferative and vasoconstrictive agent.
230	DB00241	Butalbital	Headache, Tension-Type/Tension Headache	Butalbital, or 5-allyl-5-isobutylbarbituric acid, is a derivative of barbituric acid which the hydrogens at position 5 are substituted by an allyl group and an isobutyl group. It is a short-to-intermediate acting member of barbiturates that exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties that produce central nervous system (CNS) depression that ranges from mild sedation to general anesthesia . Butalbital has a low degree of selectivity and a narrow therapeutic index . Typically indicated to manage tension (or muscle contraction) headaches, butalbital is often combined with one or more therapeutic agents, such as acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. There have not been clinical trials that evaluate the clinical efficacy of butalbital in migraines thus it is not indicated for such condition. As with other barbiturates, butalbital carries a risk of abuse or misuse potential, intoxication, hangover, tolerance, dependence, and overdosage possibly leading to death [FDA Label]. Butalbital‐containing analgesics can also produce a drug‐induced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Due to these risks, the use of butalbital-containing combination products is typically limited for use only in cases where other medications are deemed ineffective and such usage is advised to be carefully monitored .
231	DB00242	Cladribine	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia (CLL)/Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL)/Hairy Cell Leukemia (HCL)/Active confirmed by clinical features, confirmed by imaging features relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS)/Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma	An antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of lymphoproliferative diseases including hairy-cell leukemia.

It is presented as a racemic form in a ration 1:1 with no inter-conversion. The ranolazine product as found today was developed by Lupin Ltd and approved by the FDA in 2013. However, the original ranolazine product was developed by CV Therapeutics Inc, FDA approved in 2006 and EMA approved in 2008.
233	DB00244	Mesalazine	Crohn's Disease (CD)/Proctosigmoiditis/Ulcerative Colitis (UC)/Ulcerative Proctitis	An anti-inflammatory agent, structurally related to the salicylates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like acetylsalicylic acid, which is active in inflammatory bowel disease . It is considered to be the active moiety of sulphasalazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed) Although demonstrably effective in treating and maintaining remission for ulcerative colitis, mesalazine has historically faced a number of issues regarding its lack of stability as a pharmaceutical agent . Throughout the late seventies and the eighties, important research initiatives developed stable mesalazine formulations like the eudragit-S coating of Asacol brand mesalazine and the Pentasa brand's encapsulation of mesalazine within microgranules . In the present day, contemporary research regarding novel methods to stabilize mesalazine continues and interest in the agent's capacity to decrease inflammatory activity and subsequently potentially reduce the risk of colorectal cancer in conditions like ulcerative colitis is maintained [A174019, A174022].
234	DB00245	Benzatropine	Extrapyramidal disorder caused by neuroleptic drugs/Parkinsonism/Tardive Dyskinesia caused by neuroleptic drugs	Benztropine, with the chemical formula 3alpha-diphenylmethoxytropane, is a tropane-based dopamine inhibitor used for the symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a combination molecule between a tropane ring, similar to cocaine, and a diphenyl ether from the dialkylpiperazines determined to be a dopamine uptake inhibitor since 1970. The generation of structure-activity relationships proved that benztropine derivatives with the presence of a chlorine substituent in the para position in one of the phenyl rings produces an increased potency for dopamine uptake inhibition as well as a decreased inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine. Benztropine was developed by USL Pharma and officially approved by the FDA on 1996.
235	DB00246	Ziprasidone	Acute Agitation/Bipolar 1 Disorder/Mixed manic depressive episode/Psychosis/Schizophrenic Disorders/Treatment Resistant Major Depressive Disorder/Acute Manic episode	Ziprasidone is classified as an atypical antipsychotic and is used primarily to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is effective at reducing the rate and time of relapses in schizophrenia, and can be used to treat manic episodes in bipolar disorder although the mechanism of action is unknown.
236	DB00247	Methysergide		An ergot derivative that is a congener of lysergic acid diethylamide.  It antagonizes the effects of serotonin in blood vessels and gastrointestinal smooth muscle, but has few of the properties of other ergot alkaloids.

Its mechanism of action is probably similar to that of the sulfonamides which involves inhibition of folic acid synthesis in susceptible organisms. It is also used with pyrimethamine in the treatment of malaria. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p157-8)
240	DB00251	Terconazole	Vulvovaginal Candidiasis	Terconazole is an anti-fungal drug that is mainly used to treat vaginal yeast infections (or vaginal candidiasis). It is classified as a triazole ketal derivative. Terconazole was initially approved by the FDA in 1987.[FDA label] This drug is available in cream and suppository forms and both have demonstrated high levels of safety, efficacy, and tolerability in clinical trials.
241	DB00252	Phenytoin	Complex Partial Seizures/Grand mal Generalized tonic-clonic seizure/Seizures	An anticonvulsant that is used in a wide variety of seizures. It is also an anti-arrhythmic and a muscle relaxant. The mechanism of therapeutic action is not clear, although several cellular actions have been described including effects on ion channels, active transport, and general membrane stabilization. The mechanism of its muscle relaxant effect appears to involve a reduction in the sensitivity of muscle spindles to stretch. Phenytoin has been proposed for several other therapeutic uses, but its use has been limited by its many adverse effects and interactions with other drugs.

It was conceived as part of the efforts to generate analogs of fructose-1,6-diphosphate to block gluconeogenesis in which topiramate was a synthetic intermediate. Analyzing its similarity to acetazolamide, researchers decided to study its capability as an anticonvulsant agent where was shown to be highly active against maximal electroshock seizure and to present a long duration of action. Structurally, topiramate does not resemble a normal therapeutic agent as it presents a very high concentration of oxygen. The oxygen atoms in the topiramate molecule are expected to function as acceptors for hydrogen-bond formation while its amide group serves as an important hydrogen donor. Topiramate has been approved in Europe since 2003, in the UK in 1995 and in the US since 2004. This drug has been approved for a number of conditions and in 2014 it was approved for the prevention of migraine in children.

264	DB00275	Olmesartan	Diabetic Nephropathies/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Severe Hypertension/Moderate Hypertension	"Olmesartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes telmisartan, candesartan, losartan, valsartan, and irbesartan. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 
Olmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling. By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as ramipril, lisinopril, and perindopril) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 
Olmesartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as olmesartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Like other ARBs, olmesartan blockade of RAAS slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A185906,A185909,A185912] 
Orally available olmesartan is produced as the prodrug olmesartan medoxomil which is rapidly converted in vivo to the pharmacologically active olmesartan. It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceuticals and approved in 2002.[A175345, L5560]"

269	DB00280	Disopyramide	Arrhythmia of ventricular origin	A class I anti-arrhythmic agent (one that interferes directly with the depolarization of the cardiac membrane and thus serves as a membrane-stabilizing agent) with a depressant action on the heart similar to that of guanidine. It also possesses some anticholinergic and local anesthetic properties.
270	DB00281	Lidocaine	Postherpetic Neuralgia/Arrhythmia of ventricular origin/Local Anesthesia	"Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication . In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation .
Regardless, lidocaine is currently available as a relatively non-expensive generic medication that is written for in millions of prescriptions internationally on a yearly basis. It is even included in the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines ."

274	DB00285	Venlafaxine	Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Migraine/Pain, Neuropathic/Panic Disorders/Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)/Vasomotor Symptoms	Venlafaxine (Effexor) is an antidepressant within the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) class of medications. It exerts its effects primarily by blocking the transporters involved in the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine, therefore leaving more active neurotransmitter in the synapse. Venlafaxine is officially approved for use in the management of major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. As of 2014, Canadian clinical practice guidelines recommend venlafaxine as a first-line option for treatment of generalized anxiety, social anxiety, panic disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and consider it a second-line option for management of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [A177226, A177235]. Venlafaxine is also used off-label for prophylaxis of migraine headaches , for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause , and for management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition) .

Both of these products are later conjugated to natrium sulfate by ester bonds in order to make them more water soluble.[L5605, T475] 
The conjugated estrogen product contains a mix of estrogen from which about 50% is represented by estrone sulfate followed by 25% of equilin sulfate, 15% of 17-alpha-dehydroequilenin sulfate, 3% of equilenin sulfate, 5% of 17-alpha and 17-beta-dihydroequilenin sulfate, 2% of 17-alpha-estradiolsulfate and 3% of 17-beta-estradiolsulfate. It also presents a large number of unidentified molecules with weak estrogenic activity as well as non-human molecules when it is obtained from pregnant mares urine. The conjugated estrogen mixture was approved for marketing in US in 1942 based on the efficacy against certain conditions. However, until 1986 official clinical trials were performed and this product was determined to be effective for the treatment of osteoporosis. The currently approved product of conjugated estrogens was developed by Wyeth Ayerst and FDA approved in 2003."
276	DB00287	Travoprost	Ocular Hypertension	Travoprost ophthalmic solution is a topical medication used for controlling the progression of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, by reducing intraocular pressure [FDA Label]. It is a synthetic prostaglandin F2alpha analog [FDA Label]. Having been a well-received therapeutic agent with demonstrated efficacy and safety, travoprost is currently approved by the US FDA as a first-line treatment for lowering intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypotension . Furthermore, this approval also solidifies the medication as the first and only prostaglandin analog approved by the FDA for first-line treatment of glaucoma patients that does not contain the preservative benzalkonium chloride . Moreover, travoprost is also currently approved in the EU for the decrease of elevated intraocular pressure in paediatric patients aged 2 months to &lt; 18 years with ocular hypertension or paediatric glaucoma [L5146, L5152].
277	DB00288	Amcinonide	Inflammatory Reaction/Pruritis	Amcinonide is a corticosteroid.
278	DB00289	Atomoxetine	Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)	"Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Also known as the marketed product Strattera, atomoxetine is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD including distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory. Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum. This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as DB00422, DB01576, and DB01255. Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT), and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD. 
Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as DB00422, DB01576, and DB01255) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance). However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects. Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, DB00745 and DB01018. The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor DB01156 (commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD."

The first product including etonogestrel was developed by the Merck subsidiary Organon and FDA approved in 2001.
284	DB00295	Morphine	Pain, Chronic/Severe Pain	Morphine is the main alkaloid of opium and it was first obtained from the poppy seeds in 1805. It is the most potent analgesic for chronic pain but its use is limited due to the induction of tolerance, severe withdrawal symptoms and high risk of relapse and abuse. In its pure form, morphine is ten times more potent than opium and due to this property, it was used extensively in the US Civil War which resulted in approximately 400,000 addicted soldiers. After this event, around the second half of the nineteenth-century, the science made several efforts to find a less addictive alternative which brought the synthesis of heroin. However, morphine is still the precursor to other opioids such as codeine, fentanyl, methadone, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, meperidine, and oxycodone. Morphine's first official product was developed by West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Int. and FDA approved in 1984.

299	DB00310	Chlorthalidone	Calcium Nephrolithiasis	"Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic used for the treatment of hypertension and for management of edema caused by conditions such as heart failure or renal impairment. Chlorthalidone improves blood pressure and swelling by preventing water absorption from the kidneys through inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter in the distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume, decreased cardiac output and therefore overall reduction in blood pressure. Chlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension. In particular, the ALLHAT trial confirmed the role of thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy and demonstrated that chlorthalidone had a statistically significant lower incidence of stroke and heart failure when compared to DB00722, DB00381, or DB00590.[A173884, A173887] Further studies have indicated that low-dose thiazides are as good as, and in some secondary endpoints, better than β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers or ARBs.
Chlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as DB00999. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase–dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects."
300	DB00311	Ethoxzolamide		Ethoxzolamide is a sulfonamide used as diuretic and in glaucoma. It inhibits carbonic anhydrase activity in proximal renal tubules to decrease reabsorption of water, sodium, potassium, bicarbonate. Its pharmacological activity thus confers the risk for hypokalemia.

They are used to prevent or treat several conditions that may cause hypocalcemia (not enough calcium in the blood). The body needs calcium to make strong bones. Calcium is also needed for the heart, muscles, and nervous system to work properly.
316	DB00327	Hydromorphone	Pain NOS/Pain, Neuropathic/Refractory Chronic Cough	Hydromorphone is a pure opioid, a semi-synthetic hydrogenated ketone derivative of morphine that has been available clinically since 1920. Structurally, hydromorphone derived from morphine in the modification of the hydroxyl group in the carbon 6 to a carbonyl and the absence of a double bond between the carbon 7 and 8. Due to these modifications, it presents a very high potency and comparable side effect profile to the parent compound. Even though hydromorphone does not present a 6-hydroxyl group, it is categorized under the family of phenanthrenes and it is considered a chemical under the schedule II (medical purposes with high addiction potential). The first reported approved product containing hydromorphone in the form of hydromorphone hydrochloride was developed by Fresenius Kabi USA and FDA approved in 1984.
317	DB00328	Indomethacin	Acute Gouty Arthritis/Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/Bursitis/Osteoarthritis (OA)/Pain, Acute/Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)/Rheumatoid Arthritis/Tendinitis	Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid. The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, along with other acetic acid derivatives such as diclofenac and sulindac that were also developed during the 1960s. Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders. Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants. Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.
318	DB00330	Ethambutol	Mycobacterium Infections/Mycobacterium avium complex infection/Pulmonary Tuberculosis (TB)	An antitubercular agent that inhibits the transfer of mycolic acids into the cell wall of the tubercle bacillus.

319	DB00331	Metformin	Polycystic Ovaries Syndrome/Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus/Glycemic Control	"Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent of the biguanide class, used for the management of type II diabetes) [FDA label].  Currently, metformin is the first drug of choice for the management of type II diabetes and is prescribed to at least 120 million people worldwide . 
Metformin is considered an antihyperglycemic drug because it lowers blood glucose concentrations in type II diabetes without causing hypoglycemia. Metformin is commonly described as an insulin sensitizer leading to a decrease in insulin resistance and a clinically significant reduction of plasma fasting insulin levels . Another well-known benefit of this drug is modest weight loss. Metformin is the drug of choice for obese type II diabetes patients .
Metformin was first approved in Canada in 1972 , followed by 1995 in the USA [FDA label]. This drug is available in regular and extended-release forms [FDA label]."
320	DB00332	Ipratropium	Asthma Bronchial/Bronchospasm/Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)/Nasal Congestion Associated With the Common Cold/Non-Allergic Rhinitis/Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR)/Acute asthma exacerbations	Ipratropium is a quaternary ammonium derivative of atropine that acts as an anticholinergic agent. It is commonly administered through inhalation which allows producing a local effect without presenting a significant systemic absorption. Ipratropium as a therapeutic agent was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and its first monotherapy product was FDA approved in 1986. On the other hand, the combination product of ipratropium and albuterol was approved in 1996.
321	DB00333	Methadone	Opioid Addiction/Opioid Detoxification/Severe Pain	"Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.[F4685,F4688,F4691,A185885,A185900,A185903] 
Due to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.[A185888,A185891,A185897] Compared with morphine, the gold standard reference opioid, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors, as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake.[A497,A5344] Specifically by inhibiting the NMDA receptor, methadone dampens a major excitatory pain pathway within the central nervous system. Compared to other opioids, methadone's effects on NMDA inhibition may explain it's improved analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid tolerance.[A185891,A185894]
Methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and fentanyl. However, it also has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Compared with short-acting and even extended-release formulations of morphine, methadone displays a comparatively longer duration of action and half-life. These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, methadone also has and unpredictable half-life with interindividual variability, which leads to an unpredictable risk of respiratory depression and overdose when initiating or titrating therapy. Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis, sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. At higher doses, methadone use can result in respiratory depression, overdose, and death.[F4685,F4688,F4691]
Treatment of opioid addiction with methadone, buprenorphine, or slow-release oral morphine (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to lead to social stabilization by reducing crime rates, incarceration, use of illicit opioids such as heroin or fentanyl, and ultimately marginalization. Illegally purchased opioids present many other harms in addition to overdose as they can be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use such as contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis."
322	DB00334	Olanzapine	Acute Agitation/Acute Depressive Episode/Bipolar 1 Disorder/Bipolar Disorder With Manic or Mixed Episodes/Delirium/Delusional Parasitosis/Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome/Major depressive disorder, recurrent episode/Mixed manic depressive episode/Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)/Psychosis/Schizophrenic Disorders/Acute Manic episode	Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine classified as an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic agent. The second-generation antipsychotics were introduced in the 90s and quickly widespread due to the presumed higher efficacy, less extrapyramidal side effects and fewer drug-drug interactions. Olanzapine presents a very close resemblance to clozapine and it only differs by two additional methyl groups and the absence of a chloride moiety. It was obtained by the research of Eli Lilly and approved to be marketed in the US in 1996.

329	DB00341	Cetirizine	Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria/Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR)/Pollen Allergy/Respiratory Allergy/Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR)	"Cetirizine, also commonly known as Zyrtec, is an orally active second-generation histamine H1 antagonist proven effective in the treatment of various allergic symptoms, such as sneezing, coughing, nasal congestion, hives, and other symptoms , . 
One of the most common uses for this drug is for a condition called allergic rhinitis. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in the United States is about 15% according to physician diagnoses, and up to 30%, according to self-reported nasal symptoms. Allergic rhinitis is associated with multiple missed or unproductive days at work and school, problems with sleep, and other difficulties with day to day activities for many individuals . Furthermore, some antihistamine agents that are used to treat this condition cause undesirable, sedating effects . 
Cetirizine is one of the first second-generation H1 antihistamines (SGAHs)formulated to selectively inhibit the H1 receptor without sedating effects ."

Approved in 1982 by the FDA, it is a member of the non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers drug class. It works through various mechanisms of action, but it primarily works by inhibiting the calcium influx into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle during depolarization.[label] Compared to dihydropyridine drugs, such as nifedipine, that preferentially act on vascular smooth muscle and verapamil that directly acts on the heart muscle, diltiazem displays an intermediate specificity to target both the cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. Being a potent vasodilator, diltiazem is used clinically as an antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic, and as an anti-anginal agent for the management of cardiovascular conditions such as hypertension, chronic stable angina, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter. Apart from its main FDA-approved indications, diltiazem has also been used for numerous off-label indications, such as anal fissures (in topical formulations), migraine prophylaxis, pulmonary hypertension, and rest-related cramps in the lower extremities. Typically available in extended-release oral and intravenous formulations, diltiazem is marketed under various brand names with Cardizem and Tiazac being the most common ones.
332	DB00344	Protriptyline	Depression	Protriptyline hydrochloride is a dibenzocycloheptene-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, protriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, protriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical β-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H1 receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Protriptyline may be used for the treatment of depression.

363	DB00375	Colestipol	Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type Ⅱa)	"Bile acid sequestrants like colestipol have been in use since the 1970s.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262] And even though such an agent may very well be useful in reducing elevated cholesterol levels and decreasing the risk for atherosclerotic vascular disease due to hypercholesterolemia, colestipol is still generally only employed as an adjunct therapy and the relatively physical nature of its pharmacological activity sometimes limits its usefulness.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262]
In particular, as colestipol's general mechanism of action ultimately results in the decreased absorption and enhanced secretion of bile acids and lipids in the feces, patients who take complicated medication regimens, experience constipation or biliary obstruction, etc. may not be good candidates for using the agent owing to its physical effects on the gut.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262]
Alternatively, colestipol predominantly elicits its activities within the gut environment because it undergoes little absorption and metabolism.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262] The resultant lack of systemic exposure consequently means the medication generally demonstrates very few adverse effects inside the body.[FDA Label, F4555, F4567, L6262]"

372	DB00384	Triamterene	High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Oedema/Idiopathic Edema	Triamterene (2,4,7-triamino-6-phenylpteridine) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is used in the management of hypertension. It works by promoting the excretion of sodium ions and water while decreasing the potassium excretion in the distal part of the nephron in the kidneys by working on the lumenal side. Since it acts on the distal nephron where only a small fraction of sodium ion reabsorption occurs, triamterene is reported to have limited diuretic efficacy. Due to its effects on increased serum potassium levels, triamterene is associated with a risk of producing hyperkalemia. Triamterene is a weak antagonist of folic acid, and a photosensitizing drug. Triamterene was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. in 1964. Currently, triamterene is used in the treatment of edema associated with various conditions as monotherapy and is approved for use with other diuretics to enhance diuretic and potassium-sparing effects.[label] It is also found in a combination product with hydrochlorothiazide that is used for the management of hypertension or treatment of edema in patients who develop hypokalemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone.

380	DB00393	Nimodipine	Hunt and Hess Grades I-V Subarachnoid hemorrhage	Nimodipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nimodipine prevents calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. Compared to other calcium channel blocking agents, nimodipine exhibits greater effects on cerebral circulation than on peripheral circulation. Nimodipine is used to as an adjunct to improve the neurologic outcome following subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured intracranial aneurysm.

It is a prodrug of an active metabolite beclomethasone 17-monopropionate (17-BMP) which acts on the glucocorticoid receptor to mediates its therapeutic action. Beclomethasone dipropionate itself posesses weak glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and is rapidly converted into 17-BMP upon administration. Formulations for oral inhalation, intranasal, and topical use are available for beclomethasone dipropionate. Beclomethasone dipropionate became first available in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in 1972 and later in a dry powder inhaler and an aqueous nasal spray. Due to its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and anti-allergy properties, beclomethasone dipropionate is used in various inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and dermatoses to reduce symptoms. When inhaled, it is proposed that beclomethasone dipropionate remains active locally in the lung without causing significant side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids. Compared to earlier corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and prednisolone, beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to be less irritating to the nasal mucosa with a longer duration of action when administered intranasally.
382	DB00395	Carisoprodol	Pain, Acute/Acute Discomfort	"Originally approved by the FDA in 1959 [FDA label], carisoprodol is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used in painful musculoskeletal conditions in conjunction with physical therapy and other medications .

397	DB00410	Mupirocin	Impetigo/Impetigo caused by Staphylococcus aureus/Impetigo caused by streptococcus pyogenes/Secondary infection Skin infection/Staphylococcus aurea colonization of the nasal passage	Mupirocin, formerly termed pseudomonic acid A, is a novel antibacterial agent with a unique chemical structure and mode of action apart from other antibiotic agents. Produced by fermentation using the organism Pseudomonas fluorescens, mupirocin is a naturally-occurring antibiotic that displays a broad-specturm activity against many gram-positive bacteria and certain gram-negative bacteria in vitro.[label] It primarily works by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Due to its unique mode of action of inhibiting the activity of bacterial isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, mupirocin does not demonstrate cross-resistance with other classes of antimicrobial agents, giving it a therapeutic advantage.[label] It is available in topical formulations only due to extensive systemic metabolism and is used in the treatment of impetigo caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes and traumatic skin lesions due to secondary skin infections caused by S. aureus and S. pyogenes. There is also some clinical evidence that suggests the potential role of mupirocin in eradicating nasal carriage of Staphylococci when administered intranasally.[A178531,A178591] Mupirocin is commonly marketed under the brand name Bactroban.

399	DB00412	Rosiglitazone	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Rosiglitazone is an anti-diabetic drug in the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline as a stand-alone drug (Avandia) and in combination with metformin (Avandamet) or with glimepiride (Avandaryl). Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARγ. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ, and has no PPARα-binding action. Apart from its effect on insulin resistance, it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect: nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) levels fall and inhibitor (IκB) levels increase in patients on rosiglitazone. Recent research has suggested that rosiglitazone may also be of benefit to a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease not expressing the ApoE4 allele. This is the subject of a clinical trial currently underway.

Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and causes a high level of disability in patients , leading to increased difficulty in performing activities of daily living due to symptoms that progress over time . The prevalence of Parkinson's Disease worldwide has increased from approximately 2.5 million in 1990 to about 6.1 million in 2016 .  This increase may be attributed to an aging population along with other contributing factors .
In addition to the above FDA approval for Parkinson's Disease, pramipexole was also approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) . RLS is a sleep-related disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the lower extremities, often accompanied by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs ."

Spironolactone was originally developed purely for this ability before other pharmacodynamic properties of the drug were discovered.[A11837,A178246] It is indicated to treat a number of conditions including heart failure, deem, hyperaldosteronism, adrenal hyperplasia, hypertension, and nephrotic syndrome.[Label] Off label uses of spironolactone involving its antiandrogenic activity include hirsutism, female pattern hair loss, and adult acne vulgaris. Spironolactone is also frequently used in medical gender transition. Spironolactone was developed in 1957, marketed in 1959, and approved by the FDA on January 21, 1960.[A178243,L6187]
409	DB00422	Methylphenidate	Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)/Narcolepsy	"Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant used most commonly in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and for narcolepsy. Also known as the marketed products Ritalin, Concerta, or Biphentin, methylphenidate is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, DB01576, and DB01255 are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD, and are considered first-line options for children, adolescents, and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance). CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies, of over twenty years in duration, which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.  
While its exact mechanism is unclear, methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action. There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects. The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory.[A177541, A177544] Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity. Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action. When provided as Biphentin®, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the work day, etc).
When provided as Concerta®, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release. OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.
Methylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate, which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT). In particular, increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects. Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including DB00289 and DB01018."

438	DB00451	Levothyroxine	Hypothyroidism/Myxedema coma/Euthyroid Goitre/Thyrotropin dependent Thyroid cancer	"Levothyroxine is a synthetically produced form of thyroxine, a major endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland. Also known as L-thyroxine or the brand name product Synthroid, levothyroxine is used primarily to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland is no longer able to produce sufficient quantities of the thyroid hormones T4 (tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine or DB00279), resulting in diminished down-stream effects of these hormones. Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression , dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.[F4636,A35722]
In response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T4, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5′-deiodinases) into its active metabolite T3. While T4 is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T3 exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T4 and T3 have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3). T4 and T3 act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system. As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status. Prior to the development of levothyroxine, DB09100 or desiccated thyroid, used to be the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism. However, this is no longer recommended for the majority of patients due to several clinical concerns including limited controlled trials supporting its use. Desiccated thyroid products contain a ratio of T4 to T3 of 4.2:1, which is significantly lower than the 14:1 ratio of secretion by the human thyroid gland. This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.[A35722, F4636]"

445	DB00458	Imipramine	Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)/Bulimia Nervosa (BN)/Enuresis/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Pain, Neuropathic/Panic Disorders/Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)	Imipramine, the prototypical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), is a dibenzazepine-derivative TCA. TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, imipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H1 receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively . Imipramine has less sedative and anticholinergic effects than the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Imipramine may be used to treat depression and nocturnal enuresis in children [FDA Label]. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [L1349,L1348,A31900,L1351,L1352,L1353,A31904].
446	DB00459	Acitretin	Keratinization disorders/Severe Psoriasis	An oral retinoid effective in the treatment of psoriasis. It is the major metabolite of etretinate with the advantage of a much shorter half-life when compared with etretinate.
447	DB00460	Verteporfin	Subfoveal Choroidal Neovascularization	Verteporfin, marketed as Visudyne, is a benzoporphyrin derivative. It is used as a photosensitizer in photodynamic therapy to eliminate abnormal blood vessels in wet form macular degeneration. Verteporfin accumulates in these abnormal blood vessels and, when stimulated by nonthermal red light with a wavelength of 693 nm in the presence of oxygen, produces highly reactive short-lived singlet oxygen and other reactive oxygen radicals, resulting in local damage to the endothelium and blockage of the vessels.
448	DB00461	Nabumetone	Osteoarthritis (OA)/Rheumatoid Arthritis	Nabumetone was originally developed as a non-acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] It was thought to avoid trapping of the drug in the stomach by making it unable to dissociate into ions which was believed to reduce GI toxicity by limiting local action. While slightly reduced, possibly due to a degree of cyclooxygenase-2 selectivity (COX-2), nabumetone still produces significant adverse effects in the GI tract.[label,A178903] The molecule itself is a pro-drug with its 6-methoxy-2-naphthylacetic acid (6-MNA) metabolite acting as a potent COX inhibitor similar in structure to naproxen. Nabumetone was developed by Smithkline Beecham under the trade name Relafen and first received FDA approval in December, 1991.
449	DB00462	Methscopolamine bromide	Peptic Ulcers	A muscarinic antagonist used to study binding characteristics of muscarinic cholinergic receptors.

451	DB00464	Sodium tetradecyl sulfate	Uncomplicated Varicose vein	An anionic surface-active agent used for its wetting properties in industry and used in medicine as an irritant and sclerosing agent for hemorrhoids and varicose veins.
452	DB00465	Ketorolac	Acute Migraine/Cystoid Macular Edema/Inflammatory Reaction/Ocular Itching/Ocular Pain/Pain, Acute/Pseudophakic Cystoid Macular Edema/Acute Pericarditis/Acute, moderate Pain/Acute, severe Pain/Chronic aphakic cystoid macular edema/Intraoperative miosis/Postoperative ocular pain	Ketorolac is a Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is commercially available as an oral tablet, injectable, nasal spray and as an ophthalmic solution.     It's analgesic properties make it a useful pain management tool across many settings including postoperative pain, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, menstrual disorders, headaches, spinal and soft tissue pain, and ankylosing spondylitis. Impressively, ketorolac has a similar efficacy to standard doses of morphine and meperidine making it a useful opioid sparing agent.
453	DB00466	Picrotoxin		A noncompetitive antagonist at GABA-A receptors and thus a convulsant. Picrotoxin blocks the gamma-aminobutyric acid-activated chloride ionophore. Although it is most often used as a research tool, it has been used as a CNS stimulant and an antidote in poisoning by CNS depressants, especially the barbiturates. [PubChem]
454	DB00467	Enoxacin		A broad-spectrum 6-fluoronaphthyridinone antibacterial agent (fluoroquinolones) structurally related to nalidixic acid.
455	DB00468	Quinine	Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum	An alkaloid derived from the bark of the cinchona tree. It is used as an antimalarial drug, and is the active ingredient in extracts of the cinchona that have been used for that purpose since before 1633. Quinine is also a mild antipyretic and analgesic and has been used in common cold preparations for that purpose. It was used commonly and as a bitter and flavoring agent, and is still useful for the treatment of babesiosis. Quinine is also useful in some muscular disorders, especially nocturnal leg cramps and myotonia congenita, because of its direct effects on muscle membrane and sodium channels. The mechanisms of its antimalarial effects are not well understood.
456	DB00469	Tenoxicam	Backache/Osteoarthritis (OA)/Pain NOS/Rheumatoid Arthritis	Tenoxicam, an antiinflammatory agent with analgesic and antipyretic properties, is used to treat osteoarthritis and control acute pain.
457	DB00470	Dronabinol	Anorexia, weight loss, AIDS/Nausea and vomiting	"Dronabinol (marketed as Marinol) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body . While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or DB00486), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.
From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body . The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others . CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function ."
458	DB00471	Montelukast	Asthma Bronchial/Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)/Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR)/Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR)	Montelukast was first approved for clinical use by the US FDA in 1998 as Merck's brand name Singulair. The medication is a member of the leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) category of drugs.[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] Although capable of demonstrating effectiveness, the use of such LTRAs like montelukast is typically in addition to or complementary with the use of inhaled corticosteroids or other agents in asthma step therapy. Regardless, in 2008-2009, there were FDA-led investigations into the possibility of montelukast to elicit neuropsychiatric effects like agitation, hallucinations, suicidal behaviour, and others in individuals who used the medication. And although these kinds of effects are currently included in the official prescribing information for montelukast,[L6301,L6304,L6307,L6310,L6325,L6328,L6331] the drug still sees extensive use worldwide via millions of prescriptions annually and has since become available as a generic and as a brand name product.
459	DB00472	Fluoxetine	Alcohol Dependence/Anorexia Nervosa (AN)/BMI >30 kg/m2/Bulimia Nervosa (BN)/Cataplexy/Depression, Bipolar/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Myoclonus/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)/Panic Disorder (With or Without Agoraphobia)/Premature Ejaculation/Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder/Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD)	Fluoxetine is a 2nd generation antidepressant categorized as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). It gained FDA approval in 1987 and although it was initially intended for the treatment of depression, today it is commonly prescribed to manage depression in addition to various other pathologies.
460	DB00473	Hexylcaine		Hexylcaine hydrochloride is also known as cyclaine and osmocaine. It is a short acting local anesthetic that acts through inhibition of sodium channels. Patients experience an overdose may present with headache, tinnitus, numbness and tingling around the mouth and tongue, convulsions, inability to breathe, and decreased heart function. Hexylcaine has been discontinued in the US market.
461	DB00474	Methohexital	Induction of anesthesia therapy/Sedative therapy therapy/Adjunct to general anesthesia therapy	An intravenous anesthetic with a short duration of action that may be used for induction of anesthesia.
462	DB00475	Chlordiazepoxide	Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome(AWS)/Anxiety/Anxiety Disorders/Depression/Peptic Ulcer Disease/Acute Anxiety/Pyschosomatic disease	An anxiolytic benzodiazepine derivative with anticonvulsant, sedative, and amnesic properties. It has also been used in the symptomatic treatment of alcohol withdrawal.
463	DB00476	Duloxetine	Back Pain Lower Back Chronic/Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)/Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain/Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy (DPN)/Fibromyalgia/Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)/Knee Osteoarthritis (Knee OA)/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI)	Duloxetine is a dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.[label] It was originally discovered in 1993 and developed by Eli Lilly and Company as LY248686. Duloxetine first received approval from the FDA in August, 2004 as Cymbalta for the treatment of Major Depressive Disorder. It has since received approval for a variety of indications including the treatment of neuropathic pain, Generalized Anxiety disorder, osteoarthritis, and stress incontinence. Duloxetine continues to be investigated for the treatment of pain in cancer, surgery, and more.
464	DB00477	Chlorpromazine	Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP)/Apprehension/Mania/Nausea and vomiting/Oppositional Defiant Disorder/Restlessness/Schizophrenic Disorders/Tetanus/Intractable singultus/Severe behavioural problems/Short term Hyperactivity	The prototypical phenothiazine antipsychotic drug. Like the other drugs in this class, chlorpromazine's antipsychotic actions are thought to be due to long-term adaptation by the brain to blocking dopamine receptors. Chlorpromazine has several other actions and therapeutic uses, including as an antiemetic and in the treatment of intractable hiccup.
465	DB00478	Rimantadine	Influenza A Virus Infection	An RNA synthesis inhibitor that is used as an antiviral agent in the prophylaxis and treatment of influenza.
466	DB00479	Amikacin	Bacterial Sepsis/Bone and Joint Infections/Central Nervous System Infections/Endophthalmitis/Infection caused by staphylococci/Infective pulmonary exacerbation of cystic fibrosis/Intra-Abdominal Infections/Lung Infection/Meningitis, Bacterial/Mycobacterium avium complex infection/Neonatal Sepsis/Peritonitis bacterial/Postoperative Infections/Respiratory Tract Infection Bacterial/Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Bacterial Infections/Tuberculosis Infection/Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia/Minor burns/Severe Bacterial Infections/Severe Urinary tract infection	Amikacin is a semi-synthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic that is derived from kanamycin A.[FDA label] Amikacin is synthesized by acylation with the l-(-)-γ-amino-α-hydroxybutyryl side chain at the C-1 amino group of the deoxystreptamine moiety of kanamycin A. Amikacin's unique property is that it exerts activity against more resistant gram-negative bacilli such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amikacin also exerts excellent activity against most aerobic gram-negative bacilli from the Enterobacteriaceae family, including Nocardia and some Mycobacterium (M. avium-intracellulare, M. chelonae, and M. fortuitum) . M. avium-intracellulare (MAC) is a type of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) found in water and soil. Symptoms of this disease include a persistent cough, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, and shortness of breath and the coughing up of blood. Several forms of amikacin are used currently, including an intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) injection. In September 2018, a liposomal inhalation suspension of this drug was approved by the FDA for the treatment of lung disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) bacteria in a small population of patients with the disease who do not respond to traditional treatment.[L4680,L4681]
467	DB00480	Lenalidomide	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) - Refractory/Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)/Multiple Myeloma (MM)/Myelodysplastic Syndrome/Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma/Light chain amyloidosis	Lenalidomide (initially known as CC-5013 and marketed as Revlimid® by Celgene) is a derivative of thalidomide introduced in 2004. It was initially intended as a treatment for multiple myeloma, for which thalidomide is an accepted therapeutic modality, but has also shown efficacy in the hematological disorders known as the myelodysplastic syndromes. FDA approved on December 27, 2005.
468	DB00481	Raloxifene	Breast Cancer Invasive Nos/Osteoporosis/Osteoporosis caused by glucocorticoid	Raloxifene is a second generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mediates anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues, and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood coagulation.[A4979,T28] Exhibiting tissue-specific effects distinct from estradiol, raloxifene is the first of the benzothiophene group of antiestrogens to be labelled a SERM. Available in many countries worldwide, raloxifene was initially approved by the FDA in December, 1997 under the market name Evista® for the management and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and reduction in risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or those who are at high risk for invasive breast cancer. However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and tamoxifen have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets. The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation. Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]
469	DB00482	Celecoxib	Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP)/Osteoarthritis (OA)/Pain, Acute/Primary Dysmenorrhoea/Rheumatoid Arthritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile	Celecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is known for its decreased risk of causing gastrointestinal bleeding compared to other NSAIDS. It is used to manage symptoms of various types of arthritis pain and in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) to reduce precancerous polyps in the colon. It is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Celebrex, and was initially granted FDA approval in 1998. Interestingly, selective COX-2 inhibitors (especially celecoxib), have been evaluated as potential cancer chemopreventive and therapeutic drugs in clinical trials for a variety of malignancies.
470	DB00483	Gallamine triethiodide		A synthetic nondepolarizing blocking drug. The actions of gallamine triethiodide are similar to those of tubocurarine, but this agent blocks the cardiac vagus and may cause sinus tachycardia and, occasionally, hypertension and increased cardiac output. It should be used cautiously in patients at risk from increased heart rate but may be preferred for patients with bradycardia. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p198)
471	DB00484	Brimonidine	Ocular Hypertension/Facial erythema	"Brimonidine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist and 2-imidazoline derivative that was first introduced in 1996. It is considered to be a third generation alpha-2 aadrenergic receptor agonist, since it displays preferential binding at alpha-2 adrenoceptors over alpha-1 receptors. Brimonidine displays a higher selectivity toward the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors than clonidine or apraclonidine, which are also alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are members of the ocular hypotensive agent drug class that are used in the chronic treatment of glaucoma. Early treatment and management of glaucoma, which predominantly involves the lowering of intraocular pressure, is critical since glaucoma is considered to be a common cause of blindness worldwide.[A178948,A178969] 
Ophthalmically, brimonidine is used to lower intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Because it is oxidately stable, brimonidine is associated with fewer reports of ocular allergic reactions compared to other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists. The ophthalmic solution of brimonidine was first approved by the FDA in 1996 as Alphagan [label] and brimonidine is the only selective alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist approved for chronic treatment in glaucoma. Brimonidine is also found in ophthalmic solutions in combination with brinzolamide under the market name Simbrinza for the reduction in intraocular pressure. Unlike nonselective beta-blockers used in ocular hypertension, brimonidine is not associated with significantly adverse cardiopulmonary side effects. Thus brimonidine is an effective and safe alternative to beta-blockers, in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiopulmonary disease. The topical form of brimonidine was approved by the FDA in August 2013 for the symptomatic treatment of persistent facial erythema of rosacea in adults. It is marketed under the brand name Mirvaso. Brimonidine is the first topical treatment approved for facial erythema of rosacea."
472	DB00485	Dicloxacillin	Animal bite/Impetigo/Infection caused by staphylococci	One of the penicillins which is resistant to penicillinase.
473	DB00486	Nabilone	Refractory Nausea and vomiting	"Nabilone (marketed as Cesamet) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). Although structurally distinct from THC, nabilone mimics THC's structure and pharmacological activity through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, however it is considered to be twice as active as Δ⁹-THC. Nabilone is approved by the FDA for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].
Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body .

CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function .
In Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and Mexico, nabilone is marketed as Cesamet. It was approved in 1985 by the United States FDA for treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting that has not responded to conventional antiemetics. Though it was approved by the FDA in 1985, the drug only began marketing in the United States in 2006. It is also approved for use in treatment of anorexia and weight loss in patients with AIDS.
Nabilone is a racemate consisting of the (S,S) and the (R,R) isomers."
474	DB00487	Pefloxacin		A synthetic broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibacterial agent active against most gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

476	DB00489	Sotalol	Atrial Flutter/Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation/Severe ventricular arrhythmias	Sotalol is a methanesulfonanilide developed in 1960. It was the first of the class III anti arrhythmic drugs. Sotalol was first approved as an oral tablet on 30 October 1992. A racemic mixture of sotalol is currently formulated as a tablet, oral solution, and intravenous injection indicated for life threatening ventricular arrhythmias and maintaining normal sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation or flutter.[Label,L6373,L6376]
477	DB00490	Buspirone	Anxiety Disorders/Depression	Buspirone is a novel anxiolytic agent with a unique structure and a pharmacological profile. Belonging to the azaspirodecanedione drug class, buspirone is a serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and other sedative/anxiolytic drugs. Unlike many drugs used to treat anxiety, buspirone does not exhibit anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and muscle-relaxant properties. Due to these characteristics, buspirone been termed 'anxioselective'. First synthesized in 1968 then patented in 1975, it is commonly marketed under the brand name Buspar®. Buspirone was first approved in 1986 by the FDA and has been used to treat anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and relieve symptoms of anxiety. It has also been used as a second-line therapy for unipolar depression when the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is deemed clinically inadequate or inappropriate. The potential use of buspirone in combination with melatonin in depression and cognitive impairment via promoting neurogenesis has also been investigated.
478	DB00491	Miglitol	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	"Miglitol inhibits the breakdown complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates (such as disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides) into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body.
Miglitol should be taken at the start of a meal for maximal effect and the effect will depend on the amount of poly and oligosaccharides in the diet. Miglitol inhibits alpha-glucosidase, making less sugars available for digestion and reducing postprandial hyperglycemia.
Unlike other drugs of the same class, miglitol is not metabolized and the unmetabolized drug is excreted by the kidneys."
479	DB00492	Fosinopril	Diabetic Nephropathies/Heart Failure/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)	Fosinopril is a phosphinic acid-containing ester prodrug that belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is rapidly hydrolyzed to fosinoprilat, its principle active metabolite. Fosinoprilat inhibits ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Fosinopril may be used to treat mild to moderate hypertension, as an adjunct in the treatment of congestive heart failure, and to slow the rate of progression of renal disease in hypertensive individuals with diabetes mellitus and microalbuminuria or overt nephropathy.

Like other third-generation cephalosporins, it has broad spectrum activity against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. In most cases, it is considered to be equivalent to ceftriaxone in terms of safety and efficacy. Cefotaxime sodium is marketed under various trade names including Claforan (Sanofi-Aventis).
481	DB00494	Entacapone	Parkinson's Disease (PD)	Entacapone is a selective, reversible catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitor for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a member of the class of nitrocatechols. When administered concomittantly with levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor (e.g., carbidopa), increased and more sustained plasma levodopa concentrations are reached as compared to the administration of levodopa and a decarboxylase inhibitor.
482	DB00495	Zidovudine	Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infections/Perinatal HIV transmission/Post exposure HIV transmission	A dideoxynucleoside compound in which the 3'-hydroxy group on the sugar moiety has been replaced by an azido group. This modification prevents the formation of phosphodiester linkages which are needed for the completion of nucleic acid chains. The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA during reverse transcription. It improves immunologic function, partially reverses the HIV-induced neurological dysfunction, and improves certain other clinical abnormalities associated with AIDS. Its principal toxic effect is dose-dependent suppression of bone marrow, resulting in anemia and leukopenia. [PubChem]
483	DB00496	Darifenacin	Urinary Bladder, Overactive	"Darifenacin (Enablex®, Novartis) is a medication used to treat urinary incontinence.
Darifenacin blocks M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, which mediate bladder muscle contractions. This block reduces the urgency to urinate and so it should not be used in people with urinary retention.
It is unknown if M3 receptor selectivity is clinically advantageous in overactive bladder syndrome treatments."
484	DB00497	Oxycodone	Severe Pain/Severe, Chronic Pain/Acute, moderate Pain/Acute, severe Pain/Chronic, moderate Pain	Oxycodone is a semisynthetic opioid analgesic derived from thebaine in Germany in 1917. It is currently indicated as an immediate release product for moderate to severe pain and as an extended release product for chronic moderate to severe pain requiring continuous opioid analgesics for an extended period.[Label] The first oxycodone containing product, Percodan, was approved by the FDA on April 12, 1950.
485	DB00498	Phenindione		An indandione that has been used as an anticoagulant. Phenindione has actions similar to warfarin, but it is now rarely employed because of its higher incidence of severe adverse effects. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p234)

Cimetidine has a range of pharmacological actions. It inhibits gastric acid secretion, as well as pepsin and gastrins output. It also blocks the activity of cytochrome P-450 which might explain proposals for use in neoadjuvant therapy.
489	DB00502	Haloperidol	Aggressive Behavior/Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV)/Delirium/Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome/Huntington's Disease (HD)/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)/Psychosis/Psychotic Disorder NOS/Schizophrenic Disorders/Severe Hyperactivity/Severe disruptive behaviour disorder	"Haloperidol is a high potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic and one of the most frequently used antipsychotic medications used worldwide. While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain, it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states. It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain. Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the ""positive"" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as DB00477, DB01624, DB00623, and DB01403, haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.
Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic CYP2D6 activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations. First-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as DB00734, DB00334, DB00363, DB01224, DB01238, and DB00246. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics. The efficacy of haloperidol was first established in controlled trials in the 1960s."
490	DB00503	Ritonavir	Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infections	"Ritonavir is an HIV protease inhibitor that interferes with the reproductive cycle of HIV. Although it was initially developed as an independent antiviral agent, it has been shown to possess advantageous properties in combination regimens with low-dose ritonavir and other protease inhibitors. It is now more commonly used as a booster of other protease inhibitors and is available in both liquid formulation and as capsules. 
While ritonavir is not an active antiviral agent against hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, it is added in combination therapies indicated for treatment of HCV infections as a booster. Ritonavir is a potent CYP3A inhibitor that increases peak and trough plasma drug concentrations of other protease inhibitors such as DB09297 and overall drug exposure. American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines recommend ritonavir-boosted combination therapies as a first-line therapy for HCV Genotype 1a/b and 4 treatment-naïve patients with or without cirrhosis. 
Ritonavir is found in a fixed-dose combination product with DB09296, DB09183, and DB09297 as the FDA-approved product Viekira Pak. First approved in December 2014, Viekira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.
Ritonavir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with DB09296 and DB09297 as the FDA- and Health Canada-approved product Technivie. First approved in July 2015, Technivie is indicated in combination with Ribavirin for the treatment of patients with genotype 4 chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.
In Canada, ritonavir is also available as a fixed-dose combination product with DB09296, DB09183, and DB09297 as the Health Canada-approved, commercially available product Holkira Pak. First approved in January 2015, Holkira Pak is indicated for the treatment of HCV genotype 1b with or without cirrhosis, and when combined with Ribavirin for the treatment of HCV genotype 1a with or without cirrhosis. Inclusion of ritonavir can can select for HIV-1 protease inhibitor resistance-associated substitutions. Any HCV/HIV-1 co-infected patients treated with ritonavir-containing combination therapies should also be on a suppressive antiretroviral drug regimen to reduce the risk of HIV-1 protease inhibitor drug resistance."

525	DB00540	Nortriptyline	Acute Depressive Episode/Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)/Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Myofascial Pain Syndrome/Orofacial Pain/Pain, Chronic/Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN)/Cessation, Smoking	Nortriptyline hydrochloride, the N-demethylated active metabolite of amitriptyline, is a dibenzocycloheptene-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, nortriptyline does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, nortriptyline exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical β-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H1 receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. Compared to other TCAs, nortriptyline is less toxic and displays less drug interactions . As a more selective noadrenaline reuptake inhibitor, nortriptyline is less likely associated with the hypertensive ‘cheese reaction' . Nortriptyline exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Apart from its indication to treat depression, nortriptyline has been investigated in chronic neuropathic pain (unlabeled use), fibromyalgia , irritable bowel syndrome (unlabeled use), diabetic neuropathy (unlabeled use) , post-traumatic stress disorder (unlabeled use), and migraine prophylaxis (unlabeled use).

528	DB00543	Amoxapine	Depression/Endogenous depression/Neurotic depression/Psychotic Depression/Reactive depression	Amoxapine, the N-demethylated derivative of the antipsychotic agent loxapine, is a dibenzoxazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, amoxapine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, amoxapine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. In addition, TCAs down-regulate cerebral cortical β-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine H1 receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Amoxapine may be used to treat neurotic and reactive depressive disorders, endogenous and psychotic depression, and mixed symptoms of depression and anxiety or agitation.

It is used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the actions of muscle relaxants.
531	DB00546	Adinazolam		Adinazolam (Deracyn®) is a benzodiazepine derivative with anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative, and antidepressant properties. Adinazolam was first developed to enhance the antidepressant effects of alprazolam. It has never been approved by the FDA for clinical use.
532	DB00547	Desoximetasone	Psoriasis Vulgaris (Plaque Psoriasis)/Corticosteroid-responsive Dermatosis	A topical anti-inflammatory glucocorticoid used in dermatoses, skin allergies, psoriasis, etc.
533	DB00548	Azelaic acid	Acne Vulgaris/Inflammatory lesions caused by rosacea/Dietary and Nutritional Therapies	Azelaic acid is a saturated dicarboxylic acid found naturally in wheat, rye, and barley. It is also produced by Malassezia furfur, also known as Pityrosporum ovale, which is a species of fungus that is normally found on human skin. Azelaic acid is effective against a number of skin conditions, such as mild to moderate acne, when applied topically in a cream formulation of 20%. It works in part by stopping the growth of skin bacteria that cause acne, and by keeping skin pores clear. Azelaic acid's antimicrobial action may be attributable to inhibition of microbial cellular protein synthesis.
534	DB00549	Zafirlukast	Asthma Bronchial/Chronic Urticaria	"Zafirlukast is an oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) for the maintenance treatment of asthma, often used in conjunction with an inhaled steroid and/or long-acting bronchodilator. It is available as a tablet and is usually dosed twice daily. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is montelukast (Singulair), which is usually taken just once daily.
Zafirlukast blocks the action of the cysteinyl leukotrienes on the CysLT1 receptors, thus reducing constriction of the airways, build-up of mucus in the lungs and inflammation of the breathing passages."
535	DB00550	Propylthiouracil	Hyperthyroidism/Thyrotoxic crisis/Severe alcoholic liver disease	A thiourea antithyroid agent. Propythiouracil inhibits the synthesis of thyroxine and inhibits the peripheral conversion of throxine to tri-iodothyronine. It is used in the treatment of hyperthyroidism. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopeoia, 30th ed, p534)
536	DB00551	Acetohydroxamic acid	Chronic urea-splitting urinary infection	Acetohydroxamic Acid, a synthetic drug derived from hydroxylamine and ethyl acetate, is similar in structure to urea. In the urine, it acts as an antagonist of the bacterial enzyme urease. Acetohydroxamic Acid has no direct antimicrobial action and does not acidify urine directly. It is used, in addition to antibiotics or medical procedures, to treat chronic urea-splitting urinary infections.

Its long half-life enables it to be administered once daily.
540	DB00555	Lamotrigine	Acute Bipolar Depression/Bipolar I Disorder/Grand mal Generalized tonic-clonic seizure/Generalized seizure/Partial onset seizure Epilepsy	Lamotrigine is an antiepileptic drug belonging in the phenyltriazine class used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. For epilepsy it is used to treat partial seizures, primary and secondary tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Lamotrigine also acts as a mood stabilizer. It is the first medication since lithium granted Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the maintenance treatment of bipolar type I. In the US, lamotrigine is available as oral tablets under the market name Lamictal. Chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants, lamotrigine has relatively few side-effects and does not require blood monitoring. While lamotrigine is primarily indicated for epilepsy and bipolar disorders, there is evidence that it could have some clinical efficacy in some neuropathic pain states. Lamotrigine is also used as an off-label drug in treating other neurologic and psychiatric pathologies like borderline personality disorder . The exact mechanism of action of lamotrigine is not fully elucidated, as it may have multiple cellular actions that contribute to its broad clinical efficacy.
541	DB00556	Perflutren		"Perflutren, a diagnostic drug that is intended to be used for contrast enhancement during the indicated echocardiographic procedures, is comprised of lipid-coated microspheres filled with octafluoropropane(OFP) gas. When exposed to ultrasound waves, the microspheres resonate and ""echo"" strong signals back to the ultrasound machine. The difference in density between the gas-filled bubbles and the blood around them creates an increased level of contrast visible in the resulting ultrasound image. During echocardiography, activated Perflutren enhances images of the inner edges or borders of the heart, producing an improved image that may enable physicians to better diagnose patients."
542	DB00557	Hydroxyzine	Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome(AWS)/Nausea and vomiting/Pruritus/Psychomotor Agitation/Acute Anxiety/As pre- and postoperative and pre- and postpartum adjunctive medication to permit reduction in narcotic dosage/Sedative therapy therapy	A histamine H1 receptor antagonist that is effective in the treatment of chronic urticaria, dermatitis, and histamine-mediated pruritus.

(From Martindale, The Extra Pharmocopoeia, 30th ed, p1225)
547	DB00562	Benzthiazide		Benzthiazide is used to treat hypertension and edema. Like other thiazides, benzthiazide promotes water loss from the body (diuretics). They inhibit Na+/Cl- reabsorption from the distal convoluted tubules in the kidneys. Thiazides also cause loss of potassium and an increase in serum uric acid. Thiazides are often used to treat hypertension, but their hypotensive effects are not necessarily due to their diuretic activity. Thiazides have been shown to prevent hypertension-related morbidity and mortality although the mechanism is not fully understood. Thiazides cause vasodilation by activating calcium-activated potassium channels (large conductance) in vascular smooth muscles and inhibiting various carbonic anhydrases in vascular tissue.
548	DB00563	Methotrexate	Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)/Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL)/Bladder Cancers/Cancer, Breast/Central Nervous System Lymphoma/Choriocarcinoma/Crohn's Disease (CD)/Dermatomyositis/Disseminated Sclerosis/Extrauterine Pregnancy/Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD)/Head and Neck Carcinoma/Hydatidiform Mole/Lung Cancer Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC)/Meningeal leukemia/Polymyositis/Sarcoma, Osteogenic/Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)/Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Lung/Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)/Uveitis/Active Pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis/Advanced Alibert-Bazin syndrome/Advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma/Nonleukemic meningeal cancer/Refractory Takayasu arteritis/Severe Psoriasis/Severe, active Rheumatoid arthritis/Medically induced abortion therapy	"Methotrexate is a folate derivative that inhibits several enzymes responsible for nucleotide synthesis. This inhibition leads to suppression of inflammation as well as prevention of cell division. Because of these effects, methotrexate is often used to treat inflammation caused by arthritis or to control cell division in neoplastic diseases such as breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.[A180322,L7144,L7147,L7150,L7180]
Due to the toxic effects of methotrexate, it is indicated for treatment of some forms of arthritis and severe psoriasis only if first line treatment has failed or patients are intolerant of those treatments. Methotrexate was granted FDA approval on 7 December 1953."
549	DB00564	Carbamazepine	Acute Mania/Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome(AWS)/Generalized Tonic Clonic Seizures/Mixed manic depressive episode/Pain NOS/Partial Seizures With Secondary Generalization/Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)/Partial onset seizure Epilepsy	Carbamazepine, also known as Tegretol, is an anticonvulsant drug and analgesic drug used to control seizures and to treat pain resulting from trigeminal neuralgia. It was initially approved by the FDA in 1965. Aside from the above uses, this drug is also given to control the symptoms of bipolar 1. Interestingly, carbamazepine was the first anticonvulsant used to treat individuals with bipolar disorder.
550	DB00565	Cisatracurium	Adjunct to general anesthesia therapy/Skeletal muscle relaxation for mechanical ventilation/Smooth muscle relaxation prior to radiological procedures	Cisatracurium is a nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant for intravenous administration. Cisatracurium acts on cholinergic receptors, blocking neuromuscular transmission. This action is antagonized by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as neostigmine. The neuromuscular block produced by cisatracurium besylate is readily antagonized by anticholinesterase agents once recovery has started. As with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents, the more profound the neuromuscular block at the time of reversal, the longer the time required for recovery of neuromuscular function. Compared to other neuromuscular blocking agents, it is intermediate in its onset and duration of action.
551	DB00566	Succimer	Arsenic Poisoning/Mercury Poisoning/Poisoning, Lead/Blood lead levels above 45 mcg/dL Lead poisoning	A mercaptodicarboxylic acid used as an antidote to heavy metal poisoning because it forms strong chelates with them.
552	DB00567	Cephalexin	Bone Infection/Genitourinary tract infection/Otitis Media (OM)/Respiratory Tract Infections (RTI)/Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Bacterial Infections/Acute Prostatitis	Cephalexin is the first of the first generation cephalosporins.[A179071,A179074] This antibiotic contains a  beta lactam and a dihydrothiazide. Cephalexin is used to treat a number of susceptible bacterial infections through inhibition of cell wall synthesis.[A179083,Label] Cephalexin was approved by the FDA on 4 January 1971.
553	DB00568	Cinnarizine		First synthesized by Janssen Pharmaceuticals in 1955, cinnarizine is an anti-histaminic drug mainly used for the control of vestibular disorders and motion sickness. Cinnarizine is a specific calcium channel blocker that primarily works on the central vestibular system to interfere with the signal transmission between vestibular apparatus of the inner ear and the vomiting centre of the hypothalamus. Cinnarizine could be also viewed as a nootropic drug because of its vasorelaxating abilities (due to calcium channel blockage), which happen mostly in brain. Combination use of cinnarizine with other nootropics, such as piracetam resulted in enhanced effect of boosting brain oxygen supply.
554	DB00569	Fondaparinux	Acute Pulmonary Embolism/Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/Non ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (NSTEMI)/ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)/Unstable Angina Pectoris/Acute, superficial, symptomatic Vein Thrombosis	Fondaparinux (Arixtra) is a synthetic anticoagulant agent consisting of five monomeric sugar units and a O-methyl group at the reducing end of the molecule. It is structurally similar to polymeric glycosaminoglycan heparin and heparan sulfate (HS) when they are cleaved into monomeric units. The monomeric sequence in heparin and HS is thought to form the high affinity binding site for the natural anti-coagulant factor, antithrombin III (ATIII). Once bound to heparin or HS, the anticoagulant activity of ATIII is potentiated by 1000-fold. Fondaparinux potentiates the neutralizing action of ATIII on activated Factor X 300-fold. Fondaparinux may be used: to prevent venous thromboembolism in patients who have undergone orthopedic surgery of the lower limbs (e.g. hip fracture, hip replacement and knee surgery); to prevent VTE in patients undergoing abdominal surgery who are are at high risk of thromboembolic complications; in the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pumonary embolism (PE); in the management of unstable angina (UA) and non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI); and in the management of ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

It was initially approved by the FDA in 1995 [FDA label] and marketed by GlaxoSmithKline . Valacyclovir is the L-valine ester of aciclovir. It is a member of the purine (guanine) nucleoside analog drug class .  This class of drugs forms an important part of hepatitis, HIV, and cytomegalovirus drug regimens .
One major use of valacyclovir is the treatment of genital herpes episodes or outbreaks. Genital herpes is a frequently diagnosed sexually transmitted disease which currently affects more than 400 million individuals worldwide. It is caused by infection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV). Infection with this virus is lifelong with periodic episodes of reactivation ."
563	DB00578	Carbenicillin		Broad-spectrum semisynthetic penicillin derivative used parenterally. It is susceptible to gastric juice and penicillinase and may damage platelet function.
564	DB00579	Mazindol		Mazindol is a tricyclic anorexigenic agent that is unrelated to and less toxic than amphetamine, but with some similar side effects. It inhibits uptake of catecholamines and blocks the binding of cocaine to the dopamine uptake transporter. Mazindol is only approved in the United States for the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and is not marketed or available in the United States for use in the treatment of obesity.
565	DB00580	Valdecoxib		Valdecoxib was removed from the Canadian, U.S., and E.U. markets in 2005 due to concerns about possible increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
566	DB00581	Lactulose	Hepatic Encephalopathy/Occasional Constipation	Lactulose is a synthetic disaccharide derivative of lactose that is most commonly used as a laxative agent despite also being formally indicated to serve as an adjunct therapy in treating portal-systemic encephalopathy (PSE).[FDA Label,L6199,L6202] Despite being first synthesized in 1929 , investigations regarding its possible use as a laxative for the treatment of chronic constipation did not occur until the 1960s and its first clinical use for treating PSE was not until 1966. Nevertheless, although lactulose received formal FDA approval in 1977 and has since become a readily available generic and brand-name non-prescription medication listed on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines as one of the most effective and safe medicines employed in a health system , data regarding its optimal place in therapy is often ambiguous. Especially considering the use of lactulose as a laxative is typically only considered after lifestyle and dietary modifications fail and the fact that lactulose therapy cannot be ethically withheld from patients diagnosed with PSE in a placebo study, the substance may just be one of many options available for treating constipation and its efficacy in managing PSE may never be formally confirmed or refuted via clinical investigation.
567	DB00582	Voriconazole	Coccidioidomycosis/Esophageal Candidiasis/Fungal meningitis caused by Exserohilum Infection/Infections, Fungal/Invasive Aspergillosis/Penicillium marneffei infection/Disseminated Candidiasis/Non-neutropenic Candidemia/Refractory Fungal Infections	Voriconazole (Vfend, Pfizer) is a triazole antifungal medication used to treat serious fungal infections. It is used to treat invasive fungal infections that are generally seen in patients who are immunocompromised. These include invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, and emerging fungal infections.

569	DB00584	Enalapril	Diabetic Nephropathies/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Symptomatic Congestive Heart Failure/Asymptomatic Left ventricular dysfunction	"Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling. Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, enalaprilat, which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume.
Commonly marketed under the trade name Vasotec, enalapril was first approved by the FDA in 1985 for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is also found in a combination product containing hydrochlorothiazide that is used for the management of hypertension. The active metabolite enalaprilat is also available in oral tablets and intravenous formulations for injection."
570	DB00585	Nizatidine	Bacterial Infection Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori)/Duodenal Ulcer/Esophagitis/Gastric Ulcer (GU)/Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)/Peptic Ulcer Disease/Stress Ulcers	A histamine H2 receptor antagonist with low toxicity that inhibits gastric acid secretion.

571	DB00586	Diclofenac	Actinic Keratosis (AK)/Acute Gouty Arthritis/Acute Migraine/Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/Conjunctivitis, Seasonal Allergic/Inflammatory Disease of the Oral Cavity/Inflammatory Disease of the throat/Inflammatory Reaction/Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)/Knee Osteoarthritis (Knee OA)/Operation site inflammation/Osteoarthritis (OA)/Pain NOS/Pericarditis/Photophobia/Post-Operative Pain/Primary Dysmenorrhoea/Rheumatoid Arthritis/Acute Musculoskeletal injury/Acute Rhinitis/Localized soft tissue rheumatism/Mild to moderate joint pain/Mild to moderate pain/Minor pain/Ocular inflammatory conditions/Perioperative miosis	Diclofenac is a phenylacetic acid derivative and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).[label] NSAIDs inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and-2 which are the enzyme responsible for producing prostaglandins (PGs). PGs contribute to inflammation and pain signalling. Diclofenac, like other NSAIDs, is often used as first line therapy for acute and chronic pain and inflammation from a variety of causes. Diclofenac was the product of rational drug design based on the structures of phenylbutazone, mefenamic acid, and indomethacin. The addition of two chlorine groups in the ortho position of the phenyl ring locks the ring in maximal torsion which appears to be related to increased potency. It is often used in combination with misoprostol to prevent NSAID-induced gastric ulcers. Diclofenac was first approved by the FDA in July 1988 under the trade name Voltaren, marketed by Novartis (previously Ciba-Geigy).
572	DB00587	Cinalukast		Used in the treatment of asthma, cinalukast selectively antagonizes leukotriene D4 (LTD4) at the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor, CysLT1, in the human airway. Cinalukast inhibits the actions of LTD4 at the CysLT1 receptor, preventing airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and enhanced secretion of thick, viscous mucus.

These drugs are available as inhalers, nasal, sprays, and topical treatments for various inflammatory indications[F4355,F4358][FDA Label]. Fluticasone propionate was first approved in 1990 .
574	DB00589	Lisuride		An ergot derivative that acts as an agonist at dopamine D2 receptors (dopamine agonists). It may also act as an antagonist at dopamine D1 receptors, and as an agonist at some serotonin receptors (serotonin agonists).
575	DB00590	Doxazosin	Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Ureteric calculus	Doxazosin is an alpha-1 antagonist used for the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) symptoms and hypertension. Other members of this drug class include Prazosin, Terazosin, Tamsulosin, and Alfuzosin. Because of its long-lasting effects, doxazosin can be administered once a day. It is marketed by Pfizer and was initially approved by the FDA in 1990.
576	DB00591	Fluocinolone acetonide	Atopic Dermatitis (AD)/Dermatosis/Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)/Non-infectious Posterior Uveitis Chronic Uveitis/Psoriasis of the scalp/Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp/Uveitis/Chronic eczematous otitis externa	Fluocinolone acetonide, with the formula 6-alpha, 9-alpha-difluoro-16-alpha, 17 alpha-acetonide, is a corticosteroid that presents a high lipophilicity. It has been used extensively in dermatological preparations and it has also been investigated thoroughly for its use in implantable corticosteroid devices. This type of device containing fluocinolone acetonide was developed by Taro Pharmaceuticals and approved by FDA in May 2016.
577	DB00592	Piperazine		Piperazine is an organic compound that consists of a six-membered ring containing two opposing nitrogen atoms. First used as a solvent for uric acid, the use of piperazine as an anthelmintic agent was first introduced in 1953. Upon entry into the systemic circulation, the drug is partly oxidized and partly eliminated as an unchanged compound. Outside the body, piperazine has a remarkable power to dissolve uric acid and producing a soluble urate, but in clinical experience it has not proved equally successful. Piperazine was first introduced as an anthelmintic in 1953. Piperazine compounds mediate their anthelmintic action by generally paralyzing parasites, allowing the host body to easily remove or expel the invading organism.
578	DB00593	Ethosuximide	Petit Mal Epilepsy	An anticonvulsant especially useful in the treatment of absence seizures unaccompanied by other types of seizures.
579	DB00594	Amiloride	Ascites/Calcium Nephrolithiasis/Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Hypokalaemia/Metabolic Alkalosis/Polyuria	A pyrazine compound inhibiting sodium reabsorption through sodium channels in renal epithelial cells. This inhibition creates a negative potential in the luminal membranes of principal cells, located in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. Negative potential reduces secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. Amiloride is used in conjunction with diuretics to spare potassium loss. (From Gilman et al., Goodman and Gilman's The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, 9th ed, p705)
580	DB00595	Oxytetracycline		A tetracycline analog isolated from the actinomycete streptomyces rimosus and used in a wide variety of clinical conditions.
581	DB00596	Ulobetasol	Pruritis/Skin Inflammation	Ulobetasol (as ulobetasol propionate)  is thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. It is used for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.
582	DB00597	Gadoteridol	Abnormal vascularity of the brain/Abnormal vascularity of the spine/Lesions in the head and neck	Gadoteridol provides contrast enhancement of the brain, spine and surrounding tissues resulting in improved visualization (compared with unenhanced MRI) of lesions with abnormal vascularity or those thought to cause a disruption of the normal blood brain barrier. Gadoteridol can also be used for whole body contrast enhanced MRI including the head, neck, liver, breast, musculoskeletal system and soft tissue pathologies. n MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoteridol shortens the T1 relaxation time in tissues where it accumulates. Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoteridol in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts.
583	DB00598	Labetalol	Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Hypertensive Emergency/Hypertensive crisis/Pheochromocytomas/Subarachnoid Hemorrhage	"Labetalol is a racemic mixture of 2 diastereoisomers where dilevalol, the R,R' stereoisomer, makes up 25% of the mixture.

584	DB00599	Thiopental		A barbiturate that is administered intravenously for the induction of general anesthesia or for the production of complete anesthesia of short duration. It is also used for hypnosis and for the control of convulsive states. It has been used in neurosurgical patients to reduce increased intracranial pressure. It does not produce any excitation but has poor analgesic and muscle relaxant properties. Small doses have been shown to be anti-analgesic and lower the pain threshold. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p920)
585	DB00600	Monobenzone		Monobenzone is the monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone used medically for depigmentation. Monobenzone occurs as a white, almost tasteless crystalline powder, soluble in alcohol and practically insoluble in water. It exerts a depigmenting effect on skin of mammals by increasing the excretion of melanin from the melanocytes. It may also cause destruction of melanocytes and permanent depigmentation.
586	DB00601	Linezolid	Bacterial Infections/Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)/Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Bacterial Infections/Uncomplicated Skin and Skin Structure Infections/Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia	Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic, the first of the oxazolidinone class, used for the treatment of infections caused by multi-resistant bacteria including streptococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The drug works by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis.

589	DB00604	Cisapride		In many countries (including Canada) cisapride has been either withdrawn or has had its indications limited due to reports about long QT syndrome due to cisapride, which predisposes to arrhythmias. The FDA issued a warning letter regarding this risk to health care professionals and patients.
590	DB00605	Sulindac	Acute Gouty Arthritis/Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/Colorectal Polyps/Osteoarthritis (OA)/Rheumatoid Arthritis/Tendonitis exacerbated/Acute Subacromial bursitis/Acute supraspinatus tendinitis	Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid class that is marketed by Merck under the brand name Clinoril. Like other NSAIDs, it may be used in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Sulindac is a prodrug, derived from sulfinylindene, that is converted in vivo to an active sulfide compound by liver enzymes. There is evidence from some studies that sulindac may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than other NSAIDs, except for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor drug class. This may be due to the sulfide metabolite undergoing enterohepatic circulation thus maintaining constant blood levels of the compound without inducing gastrointestinal effects, where the drug is excreted in the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestines. While its full mechanism of action is not fully understood, sulindac is thought to primarily mediate its action by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2.
591	DB00606	Cyclothiazide		As a diuretic, cyclothiazide inhibits active chloride reabsorption at the early distal tubule via the Na-Cl cotransporter, resulting in an increase in the excretion of sodium, chloride, and water. Thiazides like cyclothiazide also inhibit sodium ion transport across the renal tubular epithelium through binding to the thiazide sensitive sodium-chloride transporter. This results in an increase in potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The antihypertensive mechanism of cyclothiazide is less well understood although it may be mediated through its action on carbonic anhydrases in the smooth muscle or through its action on the large-conductance calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channel, also found in the smooth muscle. Cyclothiazide is indicated as adjunctive therapy in edema associated with congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, and corticosteroid and estrogen therapy. It is also indicated in the management of hypertension either as the sole therapeutic agent or to enhance the effectiveness of other antihypertensive drugs in the more severe forms of hypertension.
592	DB00607	Nafcillin	Bacterial Infections	A semi-synthetic antibiotic related to penicillin, Naficillin is a narrow-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotic drug.

Bisoprolol is generally well tolerated, likely due to its β1-adrenergic receptor selectivity and is a useful alternative to non-selective β-blocker drugs in the treatment of hypertension such as Carvedilol and Labetalol. It may be used alone or in combination with other drugs to manage hypertension and can be useful in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) due to its receptor selectivity.

626	DB00641	Simvastatin	Cardiovascular Events/Heterozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia/High Cholesterol/Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia/History of coronary heart disease cardiovascular event/History of stroke or other cerebrovascular disease cardiovascular event/Mixed hypercholesterolemia	"Simvastatin, also known as the brand name product Zocor, is a lipid-lowering drug derived synthetically from a fermentation product of Aspergillus terreus. It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]
Simvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world. Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with &lt;10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]
While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as pravastatin and rosuvastatin which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]"

631	DB00646	Nystatin	Oral Candidiasis/Mucocutaneous candida infection	Nystatin is a polyene antifungal drug to which many molds and yeasts are sensitive, including Candida spp. Nystatin has some toxicity associated with it when given intravenously, but it is not absorbed across intact skin or mucous membranes. It is considered a relatively safe drug for treating oral or gastrointestinal fungal infections.
632	DB00647	Dextropropoxyphene	Pain NOS	"Dextropropoxyphene is an opioid analgesic manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of mild pain. It displays antitussive and local anaesthetic actions. Due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and overdose, possibly leading to death, dextropropoxyphene has been withdrawn from the market in Europe and the United States. The drug is often referred to as the general form, ""propoxyphene"", however only the dextro-isomer (dextropropoxyphene) has any analgesic effect. The levo-isomer appears to exhibit a very limited antitussive effect."
633	DB00648	Mitotane	Cushing's Syndrome/Inoperable Adrenocortical carcinoma	A derivative of the insecticide  dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane that specifically inhibits cells of the adrenal cortex and their production of hormones.

635	DB00650	Leucovorin	Advanced Colorectal Cancer/Advanced Esophageal Cancers/Advanced Gastric Cancer/Bladder Cancers/Folic acid antagonist overdose/Pancreatic Cancer Metastatic/Methotrexate toxicity/Pyrimethamine hematologic toxicity	"Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). 
As folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. 
Folic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects."

637	DB00652	Pentazocine	Severe Pain/Mild Pain NOS/Moderate Pain/Preanesthetic medication therapy	The first mixed agonist-antagonist analgesic to be marketed. It is an agonist at the kappa and sigma opioid receptors and has a weak antagonist action at the mu receptor. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1991, p97)
638	DB00653	Magnesium sulfate	Convulsions/Hypomagnesaemia/Occasional Constipation/Torsades de Pointes/Barium poisoning/Severe Exacerbation of asthma/Soaking aid for minor sprains and bruises	A small colorless crystal used as an anticonvulsant, a cathartic, and an electrolyte replenisher in the treatment of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia. It causes direct inhibition of action potentials in myometrial muscle cells. Excitation and contraction are uncoupled, which decreases the frequency and force of contractions. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p1083)
639	DB00654	Latanoprost	Ocular Hypertension/Increased intraocular pressure	Latanoprost is a prodrug analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha that is used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). It was initially approved by the FDA in 1998. Latanoprost is the first topical prostaglandin F2 alpha analog used for glaucoma treatment. It has been found to be well-tolerated and its use does not normally result in systemic adverse effects like other drugs used to treat elevated intraocular pressure, such as Timolol. Another benefit latanoprost is that it can be administered once a day.
640	DB00655	Estrone	Vulvovaginal Atrophy	Estrone, one of the major mammalian estrogens, is an aromatized C18 steroid with a 3-hydroxyl group and a 17-ketone. It is produced in vivo from androstenedione or from testosterone via estradiol. It is produced primarily in the ovaries, placenta, and in peripheral tissues (especially adipose tissue) through conversion of adrostenedione. Estrone may be further metabolized to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, which may be reduced to estriol by estradiol dehydrogenase.
641	DB00656	Trazodone	Alcohol Dependence/Alzheimer's Disease (AD)/Anxiety/Dementias/Eating Disorders Symptoms/Fibromyalgia/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Schizophrenic Disorders/Sleeplessness	Trazodone is triazolopyridine derivative from the serotonin receptor antagonists and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) class of antidepressants. It is used in adults and has been shown to be comparable in efficacy to other drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine receptor inhibitor (SNRIs) in the treatment of depression. A unique feature of this drug is that it does not promote the anxiety symptoms, sexual symptoms, or insomnia, which are commonly associated with SSRI and SNRI therapy. Trazodone acts on various receptors, including certain histamine, serotonin, and adrenergic receptors, distinguishing it from other antidepressants that cover a narrow range of neurotransmitters. It was initially granted FDA approval in 1981.
642	DB00657	Mecamylamine	Severe Hypertension/Moderate Hypertension/Uncomplicated Malignant hypertension	A nicotinic antagonist that is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Mecamylamine has been used as a ganglionic blocker in treating hypertension, but, like most ganglionic blockers, is more often used now as a research tool.
643	DB00658	Sevelamer	Hyperphosphataemia	Sevelamer is a phosphate binding drug used to prevent hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic renal failure. It is marketed by Genzyme under the trade name Renagel.
644	DB00659	Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Acamprosate, also known by the brand name Campral™, is a drug used for treating alcohol dependence. Acamprosate is thought to stabilize the chemical balance in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcoholism, possibly by blocking glutaminergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, while gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors are activated. Reports indicate that acamprosate only works with a combination of attending support groups and abstinence from alcohol. Certain serious side effects include allergic reactions, irregular heartbeats, and low or high blood pressure, while less serious side effects include headaches, insomnia, and impotence. Acamprosate should not be taken by people with kidney problems or allergies to the drug.
645	DB00660	Metaxalone	Pain NOS	Metaxalone is a moderate to strong muscle relaxant used in the symptomatic treatment of musculoskeletal pain caused by strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal conditions. It is marketed by King Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Skelaxin®. Its main mechanism of action is thought to involve general central nervous system depression. Metaxalone is associated with few side effects and is available as a 800 mg scored tablet.
646	DB00661	Verapamil	Atrial Flutter/Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy/Migraine/Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation/Paroxysmal Supraventricular Tachycardia/Prinzmetal's variant angina/Secondary prevention MI/Unstable Angina Pectoris/Acute Manic episode	A calcium channel blocker that is a class IV anti-arrhythmia agent.
647	DB00662	Trimethobenzamide	Nausea/Nausea and vomiting	Trimethobenzamide is a novel antiemetic which prevents nausea and vomiting in humans. Its actions are unclear but most likely involves the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ). In dogs pretreated with trimethobenzamide HCl, the emetic response to apomorphine is inhibited, while little or no protection is afforded against emesis induced by intragastric copper sulfate.
648	DB00663	Flumethasone	Dermatosis/Otitis Externa/Otomycosis caused by Aspergillus niger	Flumethasone is a moderately potent difluorinated corticosteroid ester with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic and vasoconstrictive properties. As it is a privalate salt, its anti-inflammatory action is concentrated at the site of application. This local effect on diseased areas results in a prompt decrease in inflammation, exudation and itching.
649	DB00664	Sulfametopyrazine		Long-acting plasma-bound sulfonamide used for respiratory and urinary tract infections and also for malaria.
650	DB00665	Nilutamide	Metastatic Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer	Nilutamide is an antineoplastic hormonal agent primarily used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Nilutamide is a pure, nonsteroidal anti-androgen with affinity for androgen receptors (but not for progestogen, estrogen, or glucocorticoid receptors). Consequently, Nilutamide blocks the action of androgens of adrenal and testicular origin that stimulate the growth of normal and malignant prostatic tissue. Prostate cancer is mostly androgen-dependent and can be treated with surgical or chemical castration. To date, antiandrogen monotherapy has not consistently been shown to be equivalent to castration.
651	DB00666	Nafarelin	Central Precocious Puberty (CPP)/Endometriosis	A potent synthetic agonist of gonadotropin-releasing hormone with 3-(2-naphthyl)-D-alanine substitution at residue 6. Nafarelin has been used in the treatments of central precocious puberty and endometriosis. [PubChem]
652	DB00668	Epinephrine	Anaphylactic-type reactions/Angioneurotic Edema/Arterial Hypotension/Bleeding/Bronchospasm/Idiopathic Anaphylaxis/Laryngotracheobronchitis/Mild Intermittent Asthma/Nasal Congestion/Open Angle Glaucoma (OAG)/Respiratory Distress/Severe Asthma/Syncope/Urticarias/Uterine Contractions/Ventricular Fibrillation/Complete atrioventricular heart block/Resuscitation in cardiac arrest following anesthetic accidents/Serious allergic reactions/Severe hypersensitivity/Unresponsive Asystole/Unresponsive Bradycardia	"Epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, is a hormone and neurotransmitter and produced by the adrenal glands that can also be used as a drug due to its various important functions. Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Many new products/biosimilars and dosage routes have been approved under various names over the last several decades , , .  On August 16, 2018, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA gained approval to market its generic epinephrine auto-injector in 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths . Dosage delivery routes for epinephrine include intravenous, inhalation, nebulization, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection.
In general, the most common uses of parenteral epinephrine are to relieve respiratory distress due to bronchospasm, to provide rapid relief of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) reactions to drugs, animal serums and other allergens, and to prolong the action of infiltration anesthetics . In addition to the above functions, epinephrine is the primary drug administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to reverse cardiac arrest , .  It can be used in severe cases of croup ."
653	DB00669	Sumatriptan	Acute Migraine/Acute Cluster headaches	Sumatriptan is a serotonin receptor agonist commonly used to treat migraines and sometimes cluster headaches.[L6793,L6796,L6799,L6805,L6808,L6811] Sumatriptan is the first of the triptans and was made available in Europe in 1991 to treat migraines. Sumatriptan was granted FDA approval on 28 December 1992.
654	DB00670	Pirenzepine		An antimuscarinic agent that inhibits gastric secretion at lower doses than are required to affect gastrointestinal motility, salivary, central nervous system, cardiovascular, ocular, and urinary function. It promotes the healing of duodenal ulcers and due to its cytoprotective action is beneficial in the prevention of duodenal ulcer recurrence. It also potentiates the effect of other antiulcer agents such as cimetidine and ranitidine. It is generally well tolerated by patients.
655	DB00671	Cefixime	Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis caused by Streptococcus Pneumoniae/Acute Exacerbations of Chronic Bronchitis caused by Haemophilus Influenzae/Acute maxillary sinusitis caused by M. catarrhalis/Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)/Gonorrhea of anus/Lyme Disease/Otitis media bacterial/Salmonella Infections/Salmonella Typhi Infection/Shigella Infection/Streptococcal Pharyngitis/Streptococcal tonsillitis/Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections/Bacterial rhinosinusitis/Uncomplicated Gonorrhea	Cefixime, an antibiotic, is a third-generation cephalosporin like ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Cefixime is highly stable in the presence of beta-lactamase enzymes. As a result, many organisms resistant to penicillins and some cephalosporins due to the presence of beta-lactamases, may be susceptible to cefixime. The antibacterial effect of cefixime results from inhibition of mucopeptide synthesis in the bacterial cell wall.
656	DB00672	Chlorpropamide	Diabetes Insipidus/Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia.
657	DB00673	Aprepitant	Nausea and vomiting	Aprepitant, an antiemetic, is a substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor antagonist which, in combination with other antiemetic agents, is indicated for the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy. Aprepitant is a selective high-affinity antagonist of human substance P/neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors. Aprepitant has little or no affinity for serotonin (5-HT3), dopamine, and corticosteroid receptors, the targets of existing therapies for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CI NV).
658	DB00674	Galantamine	Dementia of the Alzheimer's Type/Dementias/Diffuse Lewy Body Disease/Mild Dementia	A benzazepine derived from norbelladine. It is found in galanthus and other amaryllidaceae. Galantamine is a cholinesterase inhibitor that has been used to reverse the muscular effects of gallamine triethiodide and tubocurarine, and has been studied as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease and other central nervous system disorders.
659	DB00675	Tamoxifen	Breast Cancer Invasive Nos/Cancer of the Ovary/Cancer, Breast/Desmoid Tumors/Endometrial Cancers/Gynecomastia/Invasive Breast Carcinoma/Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)/Puberty, Precocious/Ovulation induction therapy	Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations.[A1025,L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with anastrozole. Tamoxifen was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1977.
660	DB00676	Benzyl benzoate		Benzyl benzoate is one of the older preparations used to treat scabies. Scabies is a skin infection caused by the mite sarcoptes scabiei. It is characterised by severe itching (particularly at night), red spots, and may lead to a secondary infection. Benzyl benzoate is lethal to this mite and so is useful in the treatment of scabies. It is also used to treat lice infestation of the head and body. Benzyl benzoate is not the treatment of choice for scabies due to its irritant properties.
661	DB00677	Isoflurophate		An irreversible cholinesterase inhibitor with actions similar to those of echothiophate. It is a powerful miotic used mainly in the treatment of glaucoma. Its vapor is highly toxic and it is recommended that only solutions in arachis oil be used therapeutically. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 29th ed, p1330)
662	DB00678	Losartan	Diabetic Nephropathies/Heart Failure/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Marfan Syndrome/Strokes	Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used for a similar indication but are associated with a cough. When patients with ACE inhibitor associated coughs are switched to ARBs like losartan, they have an incidence of cough similar to placebo or hydrochlorothiazide. Losartan is available as losartan potassium oral tablets as well as a combination tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide.[L7423,L7426] Patients taking losartan should have their renal function and potassium levels monitored. Losartan was granted FDA approval on 14 April 1995.
663	DB00679	Thioridazine	Psychosis/Schizophrenic Disorders	"A phenothiazine antipsychotic used in the management of psychoses, including schizophrenia, and in the control of severely disturbed or agitated behavior. It has little antiemetic activity. Thioridazine has a higher incidence of antimuscarinic effects, but a lower incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms, than chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p618).
Thioridazine was withdrawn worldwide in 2005 due to it's association with cardiac arrythmias."
664	DB00680	Moricizine		An antiarrhythmia agent used primarily for ventricular rhythm disturbances.
665	DB00681	Amphotericin B	Coccidioidomycosis/Histoplasmosis/Infections, Fungal/Invasive Aspergillosis/Invasive Fungal Infections/Leishmaniasis/Meningitis, Cryptococcal/Meningitis, Fungal/Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis/Penicillium marneffei infection/Visceral Leishmaniasis/Candidal cystitis/Disseminated Cryptococcosis/Fungal endophthalmitis/Fungal osteoarticular infections/Ocular aspergillosis/Refractory aspergillosis/Severe Coccidioidomycosis/Severe Cryptococcosis/Severe Fungal infection caused by Basidiobolus spp./Severe Fungal infection caused by Conidiobolus spp./Severe Fungal infection caused by sporotrichosis spp./Severe Histoplasmosis/Severe Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis/Severe North American blastomycosis/Severe Systemic candidiasis	Amphotericin B shows a high order of in vitro activity against many species of fungi. Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, Candida species, Blastomyces dermatitidis, Rhodotorula, Cryptococcus neoformans, Sporothrix schenckii, Mucor mucedo, and Aspergillus fumigatus are all inhibited by concentrations of amphotericin B ranging from 0.03 to 1.0 mcg/mL in vitro. While Candida albicans is generally quite susceptible to amphotericin B, non-albicans species may be less susceptible. Pseudallescheria boydii and Fusarium sp. are often resistant to amphotericin B. The antibiotic is without effect on bacteria, rickettsiae, and viruses.
666	DB00682	Warfarin	Myocardial Infarction/Pulmonary Embolism (PE)/Strokes/Systemic Embolism/Thromboembolism/Thrombosis, Venous/Transient ischemia attacks	Warfarin is an anticoagulant drug normally used to prevent blood clot formation as well as migration. Although originally marketed as a pesticide (d-Con, Rodex, among others), Warfarin has since become the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant in North America. Warfarin has several properties that should be noted when used medicinally, including its ability to cross the placental barrier during pregnancy which can result in fetal bleeding, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Additional adverse effects such as necrosis, purple toe syndrome, osteoporosis, valve and artery calcification, and drug interactions have also been documented with warfarin use. Warfarin does not actually affect blood viscosity, rather, it inhibits vitamin-k dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of various clotting factors in addition to several regulatory factors.
667	DB00683	Midazolam	Seizures, Epileptic/Refractory seizure disorders/Anaesthesia/Anxiolytic therapy therapy/Preoperative Sedation/Sedation for mechanically-ventilated patients/Preoperative amnesia	Midazolam is a short-acting hypnotic-sedative drug with anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, sedative, hypnotic, and amnesic properties. It belongs to a class of drugs called benzodiazepines. This drug is unique from others in this class due to its rapid onset of effects and short duration of action. Midazolam is available by oral, rectal, intranasal, intramuscular (IM), and intravenous (IV) routes and has been used in various biomedical applications, including dentistry, cardiac surgery, and endoscopic procedures as pre-anesthetic medication, and as an adjunct to local anesthesia. This drug was initially approved by the US FDA in 1985, and has been approved for various indications since.[FDA label] In late 2018, the intramuscular preparation was approved by the FDA for the treatment of status epilepticus in adults.[FDA label] In May 2019, the nasal spray of midazolam was approved for the acute treatment of distinctive intermittent, stereotypic seizure episodes in patients 12 years of age and older. Midazolam is considered a schedule IV drug in the United States due to the low potential for abuse and low risk of dependence.
668	DB00684	Tobramycin	Cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection/Eye infection bacterial/Intra-Abdominal Infections/Lower respiratory tract infection bacterial/Meningitis, Bacterial/Peritonitis bacterial/Septicemia gram-negative/Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Bacterial Infections/Recurrent Complicated Urinary Tract Infection/Steroid-responsive inflammation	An aminoglycoside, broad-spectrum antibiotic produced by Streptomyces tenebrarius. It is effective against gram-negative bacteria, especially the pseudomonas species. It is a 10% component of the antibiotic complex, nebramycin, produced by the same species.
669	DB00685	Trovafloxacin		Trovafloxacin is a broad spectrum antibiotic that has been commonly marketed under the brand name Trovan by Pfizer. It exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting the uncoiling of supercoiled DNA in various bacteria by blocking the activity of DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It was shown to be more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria when compared to previous fluoroquinolones. Due to its hepatotoxic potential, trovafloxacin was withdrawn from the market.
670	DB00686	Pentosan polysulfate	Cystitis interstitial	Pentosan polysulfate is a sulfated pentosyl polysaccharide with heparin-like properties.
671	DB00687	Fludrocortisone	Primary adrenocortical insufficiency/Secondary adrenocortical insufficiency/Salt-losing Androgenital syndrome	Fludrocortisone is a synthetic mineralocorticoid used in conjunction with hydrocortisone to replace missing endogenous corticosteroids in patients with adrenal insufficiency.[A187169,A187187] It is functionally similar to aldosterone, the body's primary endogenous mineralocorticoid, and is structurally analogous to cortisol, differing only by a fluorine atom at the 9-position of the steroid structure - this fluorination is thought to be crucial to fludrocortisone's significant mineralocorticoid potency.
672	DB00688	Mycophenolate mofetil	Heart Transplant Rejection/Kidney Transplant Rejection/Liver Transplant Rejection	"Mycophenolate mofetil, also known as MMF or CellCept, is a prodrug of mycophenolic acid, and classified as a reversible inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). This drug is an immunosuppressant combined with drugs such as Cyclosporine and corticosteroids to prevent organ rejection after hepatic, renal, and cardiac transplants. It is marketed by Roche Pharmaceuticals and was granted FDA approval for the prophylaxis of transplant rejection in 1995. In addition to the above uses, mycophenolate mofetil has also been studied for the treatment of nephritis and other complications of autoimmune diseases. Unlike another immunosuppressant class, the calcineurin inhibitors, MMF generally does not cause nephrotoxicity or fibrosis.[A180799,A180805]
Previously, mycophenolic acid (MPA) was administered to individuals with autoimmune diseases beginning in the 1970s, but was discontinued due to gastrointestinal effects and concerns over carcinogenicity. The new semi-synthetic 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA was synthesized to avoid the gastrointestinal effects associated with the administration of MPA. It demonstrates an increased bioavailability, a higher efficacy, and reduced gastrointestinal effects when compared to MPA."
673	DB00689	Cephaloglycin		A cephalorsporin antibiotic that is no longer commonly used.
674	DB00690	Flurazepam	Sleeplessness	A benzodiazepine derivative used mainly as a hypnotic.
675	DB00691	Moexipril	High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)	Moexipril is a non-sulfhydryl containing precursor of the active angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor moexiprilat. It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension). It works by relaxing blood vessels, causing them to widen. Lowering high blood pressure helps prevent strokes, heart attacks and kidney problems.
676	DB00692	Phentolamine	Hypertensive crisis/Necrosis caused by Administration site extravasation, Norepinephrine/Pheochromocytomas/Anesthesia reversal	A nonselective alpha-adrenergic antagonist. It is used in the treatment of hypertension and hypertensive emergencies, pheochromocytoma, vasospasm of raynaud disease and frostbite, clonidine withdrawal syndrome, impotence, and peripheral vascular disease.
677	DB00693	Fluorescein	Peritoneal dialysis therapy/Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia	A phthalic indicator dye that appears yellow-green in normal tear film and bright green in a more alkaline medium, such as the aqueous humor, and is used therapeutically as a diagnostic aid in corneal injuries and corneal trauma. It has been approved by FDA for use in externally applied drugs and cosmetics. (From Merck Index, 12th ed; American Medical Association Drug Evaluations; 1995, p2275)
678	DB00694	Daunorubicin	Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL)/Acute erythroid leukemia/Acute monocytic leukaemia/Leukemia Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)	A very toxic anthracycline aminoglycoside antineoplastic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius and others, used in treatment of leukemia and other neoplasms.
679	DB00695	Furosemide	Acute Pulmonary Edema/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Oedema	Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts on the kidneys to ultimately increase water loss from the body. An anthranilic acid derivative, furosemide is most commonly used for edema secondary to various clinical conditions, such as congestive heart failure exacerbation, liver failure, or renal failure, and high blood pressure. It mainly works by inhibiting electrolyte reabsorption from the kidneys and enhancing the excretion of water from the body. Furosemide has a fast onset and short duration of diuretic action and has been used safely and effectively in both pediatric and adult patient populations. Being a potent diuretic, the use of furosemide is thought to be particularly beneficial when an agent with greater diuretic potential is desired. Intramuscular and intravenous formulations of furosemide may be used in individuals with impaired gastrointestinal absorption or when oral administration of the drug is clinically unsuitable. It is proposed that parenteral use should be replaced with oral furosemide, in the form of tablets or oral solution, as soon as practical.
680	DB00696	Ergotamine	Cluster Headache/Migraine/Vascular Headaches	A vasoconstrictor found in ergot of Central Europe. It is an alpha-1 selective adrenergic agonist and is commonly used in the treatment of migraine disorders.
681	DB00697	Tizanidine	Acute Low Back Pain/Drug Withdrawal Headache/Migraine/Muscle Spasticity/Seizures/Sleeplessness/Withdrawal From Addictive Substance; Detoxification	"Tizanidine is a fast-acting drug used for the management of muscle spasm, which may result from the effects of multiple sclerosis, stroke, an acquired brain injury, or a spinal cord injury .  It may also be caused by musculoskeletal injury .  Regardless of the cause, muscle spasticity can be an extremely painful and debilitating condition. 
Initially approved by the FDA in 1996, tizanidine is an Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist reducing spasticity by the presynaptic inhibition of excitatory neurotransmitters that cause firing of neurons promoting muscle spasm [FDA label]."
682	DB00698	Nitrofurantoin	Acute Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)	Nitrofurantoin is a nitrofuran antibiotic used to treat uncomplicated urinary tract infections.[L6856,L6859,L6862] Nitrofurantoin is converted by bacterial nitroreductases to electrophilic intermediates which inhibit the citric acid cycle as well as synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. This drug is more resistant to the development of bacterial resistance because it acts on many targets at once. Nitrofurantoin is a second line treatment to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Nitrofurantoin was granted FDA approval on 6 February 1953.
683	DB00699	Nicergoline		An ergot derivative that has been used as a cerebral vasodilator and in peripheral vascular disease. It has been suggested to ameliorate cognitive deficits in cerebrovascular disease.
684	DB00700	Eplerenone	High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/LVEF <40% Congestive heart failure/Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA Class II)	Eplerenone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist similar to spironolactone, has been shown to produce sustained increases in plasma renin and serum aldosterone, consistent with inhibition of the negative regulatory feedback of aldosterone on renin secretion. The resulting increased plasma renin activity and aldosterone circulating levels do not overcome the effects of eplerenone. Eplerenone selectively binds to recombinant human mineralocorticoid receptors relative to its binding to recombinant human glucocorticoid, progesterone and androgen receptors.
685	DB00701	Amprenavir		Amprenavir is a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection.
686	DB00702	Icodextrin	Dialysis therapy	Icodextrin is an iso-osmotic peritoneal dialysis solution containing glucose polymers. It is used primarily for ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) of diabetic patients and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) for patients with end-stage renal disease. It is injected as a solution into the peritoneal cavity. The drug is absorbed via convective transport via peritoneal lymphatic pathways.
687	DB00703	Methazolamide	Open-angle Glaucoma (OAG)/Acute Angle closure glaucoma	A carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used as a diuretic and in the treatment of glaucoma. [PubChem]
688	DB00704	Naltrexone	Alcohol Dependence/BMI >30 kg/m2/Cholestatic pruritus/Opioid Dependence/Severe Pain	Derivative of noroxymorphone that is the N-cyclopropylmethyl congener of naloxone. It is a narcotic antagonist that is effective orally, longer lasting and more potent than naloxone, and has been proposed for the treatment of heroin addiction. The FDA has approved naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence.
689	DB00705	Delavirdine	Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Infection	A potent, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor with activity specific for HIV-1.
690	DB00706	Tamsulosin	Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)/Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy (BPH)/Bladder Outlet Obstruction/Ureteral Calculus	Tamsulosin is a selective alpha-1A and alpha-1B adrenoceptor antagonist that exerts its greatest effect in the prostate and bladder, where these receptors are most common.[Label] It is indicated for the treatment of signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hypertrophy.[Label] Antagonism of these receptors leads to relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate and detrusor muscles in the bladder, allowing for better urinary flow.[Label] Other alpha-1 adrenoceptor antagonists developed in the 1980s were less selective and more likely to act on the smooth muscle of blood vessels, resulting in hypotension. Tamsulosin was first approved by the FDA on April 15, 1997.

693	DB00709	Lamivudine	Hepatitis B Chronic Infection/Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Infections	A reverse transcriptase inhibitor and zalcitabine analog in which a sulfur atom replaces the 3' carbon of the pentose ring. It is used to treat Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) and hepatitis B (HBV).
694	DB00710	Ibandronate	Bone Metastases/Hypercalcemia of Malignancy/Osteoporosis	Ibandronate is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate in the same class as alendronate and risedronate. Ibandronate inhibits osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. All of the bisphosphonates prevent the breakdown of bone by bone cells called osteoclasts. In persons who are at high risk for osteoporosis, bisphosphonates not only result in increased amounts of bone and bone strength, they also reduce the risk of hip fractures and other bone fractures.
695	DB00711	Diethylcarbamazine		An anthelmintic used primarily as the citrate in the treatment of filariasis, particularly infestations with Wucheria bancrofti or Loa loa.
696	DB00712	Flurbiprofen	Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/Dysmenorrhea/Osteoarthritis (OA)/Pain, Inflammatory/Rheumatoid Arthritis	Flurbiprofen, a propionic acid derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with antipyretic and analgesic activity. Oral formulations of flurbiprofen may be used for the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and anklylosing spondylitis. Flurbiprofen may also be used topically prior to ocular surgery to prevent or reduce intraoperative miosis. Flurbiprofen is structurally and pharmacologically related to fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and ketoprofen.
697	DB00713	Oxacillin	Catheter Related Infections/Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)/Infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci/Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections/Surgical Site Infections	An antibiotic similar to flucloxacillin used in resistant staphylococci infections.
698	DB00714	Apomorphine	Mobility decreased	A derivative of morphine that is a dopamine D2 agonist. It is a powerful emetic and has been used for that effect in acute poisoning. It has also been used in the diagnosis and treatment of parkinsonism, but its adverse effects limit its use.
699	DB00715	Paroxetine	Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)/Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)/Panic Disorders/Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)/Premature Ejaculation/Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder/Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD)/Vasomotor Symptoms	Paroxetine is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drug commonly known as Paxil. It has a variety of uses, including the treatment of anxiety disorders, major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and symptoms of menopause, among others. It was approved by the FDA in the early 1990s and marketed by SmithKline Beecham.[L7712,L7715] A unique feature of this drug is that it is highly potent and selective in its inhibition of serotonin reuptake and has little effect on other neurotransmitters. Because of its potent inhibition of serotonin reuptake, paroxetine is more likely to cause withdrawal effects upon cessation. Paroxetine is well tolerated in most patients with a similar adverse effect profile to other members of its drug class. The controlled release formulation was designed to decrease the likelihood of nausea that is sometimes associated with paroxetine.[L7700,L7742]
700	DB00716	Nedocromil	Asthma Bronchial/Itching of the eye	A pyranoquinolone derivative that inhibits activation of inflammatory cells which are associated with asthma, including eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, mast cells, monocytes, and platelets.
701	DB00717	Norethisterone	Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding/Endometriosis/Endometriosis related pain/Estrogen Deficiency/Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (PMO)/Secondary Amenorrhea/Vasomotor Symptoms/Vulvovaginal Atrophy/Oral Contraceptives (OC)	Norethisterone (INN, BAN), also known as Norethindrone (USAN), is a synthetic progestational hormone with actions similar to those of progesterone but functioning as a more potent inhibitor of ovulation. It has weak estrogenic and androgenic properties. The hormone has been used in treating amenorrhea, functional uterine bleeding, endometriosis, and for contraception.
702	DB00718	Adefovir dipivoxil	Hepatitis B Chronic Infection	Adefovir dipivoxil, previously called bis-POM PMEA, with trade names Preveon and Hepsera, is an orally-administered acyclic nucleotide analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor (ntRTI) used for treatment of hepatitis B. It is ineffective against HIV-1. Adefovir dipivoxil is the diester prodrug of adefovir.
703	DB00719	Azatadine		Antihistamines such as azatadine appear to compete with histamine for histamine H1- receptor sites on effector cells. The antihistamines antagonize those pharmacological effects of histamine which are mediated through activation of H1- receptor sites and thereby reduce the intensity of allergic reactions and tissue injury response involving histamine release.
704	DB00720	Clodronic acid	Hypercalcemia of Malignancy/Osteolytic Bone metastases	Clodronic acid is a diphosphonate which affects calcium metabolism. It inhibits bone resorption and soft tissue calcification.
705	DB00721	Procaine		A local anesthetic of the ester type that has a slow onset and a short duration of action. It is mainly used for infiltration anesthesia, peripheral nerve block, and spinal block. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1016). Procaine has also been investigated as an oral entry inhibitor in treatment-experienced HIV patients .
706	DB00722	Lisinopril	Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)/Cardiovascular Events/Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)/Diabetic Nephropathies/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Migraine	Lisinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) used to treat hypertension, heart failure, and myocardial infarction.[L8384,L8387,L8390] Lisinopril and captopril are the only ACEIs that are not prodrugs. It functions by inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme as well as the renin angiotensin aldosterone system.[A184781,A184808,A184817] ACEIs are commonly used as a first line therapy in the treatment of hypertension, along with thiazide diuretics or beta blockers. Lisinopril was granted FDA approval on 29 December 1987.
707	DB00723	Methoxamine		An alpha-adrenergic agonist that causes prolonged peripheral vasoconstriction. It has little if any direct effect on the central nervous system.
708	DB00724	Imiquimod	Actinic Keratoses of the face/Actinic Keratoses of the scalp/Condylomata Acuminata/Herpes Simplex Infection/Molluscum Contagiosum/Superficial Basal Cell Carcinoma	Imiquimod is an immune response modifier that acts as a toll-like receptor 7 agonist. Imiquimod is commonly used topically to treat warts on the skin of the genital and anal areas. Imiquimod does not cure warts, and new warts may appear during treatment. Imiquimod does not fight the viruses that cause warts directly, however, it does help to relieve and control wart production. Miquimod is also used to treat a skin condition of the face and scalp called actinic keratoses and certain types of skin cancer called superficial basal cell carcinoma.
709	DB00725	Homatropine methylbromide	Coughing	Homatropine methylbromide is a quaternary ammonium muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist belonging to the group of medicines called anti-muscarinics. Homatropine is used to treat duodenal or stomach ulcers or intestine problems. It can be used together with antacids or other medicine in the treatment of peptic ulcer. It may also be used to prevent nausea, vomiting, and motion sickness.
710	DB00726	Trimipramine	Depression/Nocturnal Enuresis/Sleeplessness	Tricyclic antidepressant similar to imipramine, but with more antihistaminic and sedative properties.
711	DB00727	Nitroglycerin	Angina Pectoris/Angina attack/Chronic Anal Fissures/Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)/Coronary Artery Spasm/Gastroesophageal variceal hemorrhage prophylaxis/Perioperative Hypertension/Esophageal spastic disorders	Nitroglycerin is a vasodilator drug used for the treatment of chest pain and high blood pressure.[T628,L4429] It was first approved in 2000 and is currently marketed by Pfizer, and other companies, depending on the dosage form.[T628,L4894] Nitroglycerin is available in various forms, including a spray form, sublingual tablet form, intravenous form, extended-release tablet form, and transdermal form.  A less commonly known fact is that in addition to treating angina, nitroglycerin is also used in an ointment to treat the pain that accompanies anal fissures. The rectal ointment form of nitroglycerin was approved by the FDA in 1955.
712	DB00728	Rocuronium	Muscle fasciculation caused by succinylcholine/Curarization therapy/Neuromuscular blocking therapy therapy/Facilitation of small bowel intubation therapy	Rocuronium (rapid onset-curonium) is a desacetoxy analogue of vecuronium with a more rapid onset of action. It is an aminosteroid non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker or muscle relaxant used in modern anaesthesia, to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Introduced in 1994, rocuronium has rapid onset, and intermediate duration of action. It is commonly marketed under the trade names Zemuron and Esmeron. The drug is associated with the risk of developing allergic reactions in some high-risk patients, such as those with asthma. However, there was a similar incidence of allergic reactions associated with other non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Sugammadex is a γ-cyclodextrin derivative that has been introduced as a novel agent to reverse the action of rocuronium.
713	DB00730	Thiabendazole		2-Substituted benzimidazole first introduced in 1962. It is active against a variety of nematodes and is the drug of choice for strongyloidiasis. It has CNS side effects and hepatototoxic potential. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1992, p919)
714	DB00731	Nateglinide	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Nateglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound. One minor metabolite, the isoprene, has the same potency as its parent compound.
715	DB00732	Atracurium besylate	Neuromuscular blocking therapy therapy/Facilitation of small bowel intubation therapy	A non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with short duration of action. Its lack of significant cardiovascular effects and its lack of dependence on good kidney function for elimination provide clinical advantage over alternate non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents.
716	DB00733	Pralidoxime	Toxic effect of organophosphate and carbamate/Anticholinesterase overdose	Pralidoxime is an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals. Organophosphates bind to the esteratic site of acetylcholinesterase, which results initially in reversible inactivation of the enzyme. If given within 24 hours,after organophosphate exposure, pralidoxime reactivates the enzyme cholinesterase by cleaving the phosphate-ester bond formed between the organophosphate and acetylcholinesterase.
717	DB00734	Risperidone	Acute Agitation/Acute Mania/Delusional Parasitosis/Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome/Irritability/Mixed manic depressive episode/Posttraumatic Stress Disorders/Psychosis/Schizophrenic Disorders/Treatment Resistant Major Depressive Disorder/Severe Dementia Alzheimer's type	"Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used in the treatment of a number of mood and mental health conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar mania, and as an adjunct in severe depression for example. It is one of the most widely used SGAs. 
Schizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.[L1212, L1213] Risperidone is thought to reduce this overactivity through inhibition of dopaminergic D2 receptors and serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.[L1213, A1115].
Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors [L1212, L1213, A1115]."
718	DB00735	Naftifine	Tinea Corporis/Tinea Cruris/Tinea Pedis	Naftifine is a synthetic, broad spectrum, antifungal agent and allylamine derivative for the topical treatment of tinea pedis, tinea cruris, and tinea corporis caused by the organisms Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton tonsurans and Epidermophyton floccosum.
719	DB00736	Esomeprazole	Bacterial Infection Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori)/Erosive Esophagitis(EE)/Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)/Heartburn/NSAID Associated Gastric Ulcers/Stress Ulcers/Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome/Maintenance of healing Erosive esophagitis/Postendoscopy Bleeding	"Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of H. pylori infections along with other antibiotics including DB01060, DB01211, and DB00916, for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including DB00338, DB00213, DB00448, DB05351, and DB01129. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of DB00338, which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as DB00338, without any significant differences between the two compounds in vitro. 
Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]
PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]
Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal C. difficile), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life. Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion. Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect."
720	DB00737	Meclizine	Motion Sickness/Vertigo	Meclizine is a histamine H1 antagonist with antiemetic and antivertigo properties. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of motion sickness and control of vertigo associated with vestibular system diseases. It also exhibits anticholinergic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects. Commonly marketed under the brand name Antivert in the U.S., meclizine is available as oral tablets.
721	DB00738	Pentamidine	Pneumocystis Jirovecii Pneumonia/Pneumonia, Pneumocystis Carinii/Trypanosomiasis	Antiprotozoal agent effective in trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, and some fungal infections; used in treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-infected patients. It may cause diabetes mellitus, central nervous system damage, and other toxic effects.
722	DB00739	Hetacillin		"Hetacillin is a penicillin beta-lactam antibiotic used in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by susceptible, usually gram-positive, organisms. The name ""penicillin"" can either refer to several variants of penicillin available, or to the group of antibiotics derived from the penicillins. Hetacillin has in vitro activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The bactericidal activity of Hetacillin results from the inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is mediated through Hetacillin binding to penicillin binding proteins (PBPs). Hetacillin has been withdrawn from the market since it has been discovered that it has no therapeutic advantage compared to non-ester derivatives like ampicillin."
723	DB00740	Riluzole	Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)	A glutamate antagonist (receptors, glutamate) used as an anticonvulsant (anticonvulsants) and to prolong the survival of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Riluzole is marketed as Rilutek by Sanofi.

Its synthetic counterpart is used, either as an injection or topically, in the treatment of inflammation, allergy, collagen diseases, asthma, adrenocortical deficiency, shock, and some neoplastic conditions.
725	DB00742	Mannitol	Acute Renal Failure (ARF)/Edema of the cerebrum/Increased intraocular pressure/Bladder irrigation therapy	Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic that is metabolically inert in humans and occurs naturally, as a sugar or sugar alcohol, in fruits and vegetables. Mannitol elevates blood plasma osmolality, resulting in enhanced flow of water from tissues, including the brain and cerebrospinal fluid, into interstitial fluid and plasma. As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. Mannitol may also be used for the promotion of diuresis before irreversible renal failure becomes established; the promotion of urinary excretion of toxic substances; as an Antiglaucoma agent; and as a renal function diagnostic aid.
726	DB00743	Gadobenic acid	Occlusive vascular disease	Gadobenic acid (in the form of gadobenate dimeglumine) is an MRI contrast agent used primarily for MR imaging of the liver. It can also be used for visualizing the CNS and heart. In contrast to conventional extracellular fluid contrast agents, gadobenate dimeglumine is characterized by a weak and transient binding capacity to serum proteins. This binding leads to an increased relaxivity of gadobenate dimeglumine and, consequently, to a considerably increased signal intensity over that of other agents.
727	DB00744	Zileuton	Asthma Bronchial/Chronic Asthma	Leukotrienes are substances that induce numerous biological effects including augmentation of neutrophil and eosinophil migration, neutrophil and monocyte aggregation, leukocyte adhesion, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. These effects contribute to inflammation, edema, mucus secretion, and bronchoconstriction in the airways of asthmatic patients. Zileuton relieves such symptoms through its selective inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. Specifically, it inhibits leukotriene LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 formation. Both the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers are pharmacologically active as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors in in vitro systems. The immediate release tablet of Zileuton has been withdrawn from the US market.
728	DB00745	Modafinil	Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Narcolepsy/Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA)/Shift-work related sleep disturbance/Tiredness	Modafinil is a stimulant drug marketed as a 'wakefulness promoting agent' and is one of the stimulants used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is caused by dysfunction of a family of wakefulness-promoting and sleep-suppressing peptides, the orexins, whose neurons are activated by modafinil. The prexin neuron activation is associated with psychoactivation and euphoria. The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although in vitro studies have shown it to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine by binding to the dopamine reuptake pump, and lead to an increase in extracellular dopamine. Modafinil activates glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABA.
729	DB00746	Deferoxamine	Aluminum overload/Chronic Iron Overload/Chronic aluminum overload/Acute iron intoxication	Natural product isolated from Streptomyces pilosus. It forms iron complexes and is used as a chelating agent, particularly in the mesylate form.
730	DB00747	Scopolamine	Motion Sickness/Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)/Preanesthetic medication therapy	An alkaloid from Solanaceae, especially Datura metel L. and Scopola carniolica. Scopolamine and its quaternary derivatives act as antimuscarinics like atropine, but may have more central nervous system effects. Among the many uses are as an anesthetic premedication, in urinary incontinence, in motion sickness, as an antispasmodic, and as a mydriatic and cycloplegic.
731	DB00748	Carbinoxamine	Allergic Reactions/Allergic Rhinitis (AR)/Anaphylactic-type reactions/Angioedema/Conjunctivitis, Seasonal Allergic/Urticarias/Vasomotor Rhinitis/Dermatographism	"Carbinoxamine is a first generation antihistamine that competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding. The product label for carbinoxamine as an over the counter cough and cold medicine is being modified to state ""do not use"" in children under 4 years of age in order to prevent and reduce misuse, as many unapproved carbinoxamine-containing preparations contained inappropriate labeling, which promoted unapproved uses (including management of congestion, cough, the common cold, and the use in children under 2 years of age), which can potentially cause serious health risks."
732	DB00749	Etodolac	Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA)/Osteoarthritis (OA)/Pain, Acute/Rheumatoid Arthritis	Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties. Its therapeutic effects are due to its ability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis. It is indicated for relief of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
733	DB00750	Prilocaine	Local Anesthesia	A local anesthetic that is similar pharmacologically to lidocaine. Currently, it is used most often for infiltration anesthesia in dentistry. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1992, p165)
734	DB00751	Epinastine	Conjunctivitis, Seasonal Allergic	Epinastine is used for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. It has a multi-action effect that inhibits the allergic response in 3 ways: 1. stabilizes mast cells by preventing mast cell degranulation to control the allergic response, 2. prevents histamine binding to both the H1- and H2-receptors to stop itching and provide lasting protection, and 3. prevents the release of proinflammatory chemical mediators from the blood vessel to halt progression of the allergic response.
735	DB00752	Tranylcypromine	Acute Depressive Episode	"A propylamine formed from the cyclization of the side chain of amphetamine. This monoamine oxidase inhibitor is effective in the treatment of major depression, dysthymic disorder, and atypical depression. It also is useful in panic and phobic disorders (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p311). 
Tranylcypromine is a racemate comprising equal amounts of (1R,2S)- and (1S,2R)-2-phenylcyclopropan-1-amine with the chiral centers both located on the cylopropane ring. An irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor that is used as an antidepressant (INN tranylcypromine)."
736	DB00753	Isoflurane	Anesthesia induction and maintenance therapy	A stable, non-explosive inhalation anesthetic, relatively free from significant side effects.
737	DB00754	Ethotoin	Complex Partial Seizures/Grand mal Generalized tonic-clonic seizure	Ethotoin is a hydantoin derivative and anticonvulsant. Ethotoin exerts an antiepileptic effect without causing general central nervous system depression. The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin. The latter drug appears to stabilize rather than to raise the normal seizure threshold, and to prevent the spread of seizure activity rather than to abolish the primary focus of seizure discharges. Ethotoin is no longer  commonly used.
738	DB00755	Tretinoin	Acne Vulgaris/FAB classification M3 Acute promyelocytic leukemia/Solar Lentigines/Facial fine wrinkling/Moderate Melasma/Mottled hyperpigmentation/Severe Melasma/Severe, recalcitrant Cystic acne/Tactile roughness of facial skin	Tretinoin, also known as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), is a naturally occurring derivative of vitamin A (retinol). Retinoids such as tretinoin are important regulators of cell reproduction, proliferation, and differentiation and are used to treat acne and photodamaged skin and to manage keratinization disorders such as ichthyosis and keratosis follicularis. Tretinoin also represents the class of anticancer drugs called differentiating agents and is used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).
739	DB00756	Hexachlorophene	Bacterial Infections/Antibiotic pre-surgical prophylaxis therapy/Prophylaxis of bacterial skin infections	A chlorinated bisphenol antiseptic with a bacteriostatic action against Gram-positive organisms, but much less effective against Gram-negative organisms. It is mainly used in soaps and creams and is an ingredient of various preparations used for skin disorders. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p797)
740	DB00757	Dolasetron	Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea and Vomiting (CINV)/Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)	Dolasetron is an antinauseant and antiemetic agent indicated for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderately-emetogenic cancer chemotherapy and for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Dolasetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. This drug is not shown to have activity at other known serotonin receptors, and has low affinity for dopamine receptors.
741	DB00758	Clopidogrel	Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)/Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)/Cardiovascular Events/Atherothrombotic events	Clopidogrel is a prodrug of a platelet inhibitor used to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke.[A180508,L7213] Clopidogrel is indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction for patients with non-ST elevated acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction, and in recent MI, stroke, or established peripheral arterial disease, It has been shown to be superior to aspirin in reducing cardiovascular outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease and provides additional benefit to patients with acute coronary syndromes already taking aspirin.

It is a derivative of camptothecin that inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex, and causes double-strand DNA breakage and cell death. It is a derivative of camptothecin. Irinotecan was approved for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer in October, 2015 (irinotecan liposome injection, trade name Onivyde).
746	DB00763	Methimazole	Graves' Disease/Hyperthyroidism/Toxic multinodular goiter	"Methimazole is a thionamide antithyroid agent that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones.[A184559,A184733,A184694] It was first introduced as an antithyroid agent in 1949 and is now commonly used in the management of hyperthyroidism, particularly in those for whom more aggressive options such as surgery or radioactive iodine therapy are inappropriate[L8336,L8339]. 
On a weight basis, methimazole is 10 times more potent than the other major antithyroid thionamide used in North America, Propylthiouracil, and is the active metabolite of the pro-drug Carbimazole, which is an antithyroid medication used in the United Kingdom and parts of the former British Commonwealth. Traditionally, methimazole has been preferentially used over propylthiouracil due to the risk of fulminant hepatotoxicity carried by the latter, with propylthiouracil being preferred in pregnancy due to a perceived lower risk of teratogenic effects. Despite documented teratogenic effects in its published labels,[L8336,L8339] the true teratogenicity of methimazole appears to be unclear[A184643,A184757,A184763] and its place in therapy may change in the future."
747	DB00764	Mometasone	Acute maxillary sinusitis caused by M. catarrhalis/Allergic Rhinitis (AR)/Asthma Bronchial/Dermatosis/Nasal Congestion/Polyps, Nasal	Mometasone is a medium-potency synthetic corticosteroid with anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and vasoconstrictive properties. Studies in asthmatic patients have demonstrated that mometasone provides a favorable ratio of topical to systemic activity due to its primary local effect along with the extensive hepatic metabolism and the lack of active metabolites. Though effective for the treatment of asthma, glucocorticoids do not affect asthma symptoms immediately. Maximum improvement in symptoms following inhaled administration of mometasone furoate may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
748	DB00765	Metyrosine	Pheochromocytomas	An inhibitor of the enzyme tyrosine 3-monooxygenase, and consequently of the synthesis of catecholamines.

Clavulanic acid is derived from the organism Streptomyces clavuligerus. When it is combined with amoxicillin, clavulanic acid is frequently known as Augmentin, Co-Amoxiclav, or Clavulin.[L7880,L7904,L7910]
750	DB00767	Benzquinamide		Benzquinamide is a discontinued antiemetic compound with antihistaminic, mild anticholinergic, and sedative properties. The mechanism of action is not known, but presumably benzquinamide works via antagonism of muscarinic acetycholine receptors and histamine H1 receptors.
751	DB00768	Olopatadine	Conjunctivitis, Seasonal Allergic/Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR)	Olopatadine is a selective histamine H1 antagonist and mast cell stabilizer that works by attenuating inflammatory and allergic reactions. It is a structural analog of doxepin, which has a minimal anti-allergic activity. Olopatadine works by blocking the effects of histamine, which is a primary inflammatory mediator that causes inflammatory and allergic reactions. An ophthalmic solution of olopatadine was approved by the FDA and European Union for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis in 1996 and 2002, respectively. In comparison to other anti-allergenic ophthalmic medications, olopatadine displays a good comfort and tolerability profile since it does not cause perturbation of cell membranes. Olopatadine is used for the symptomatic treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in ophthalmic formulations and seasonal allergic rhinitis in intranasal formulations. It is currently marketed under several brand names, including Pazeo, Patanase, and Opatanol.
752	DB00769	Hydrocortamate		Hydrocortamate is a synthetic glucocorticoid used for its anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive properties to treat inflammation due to corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses.

753	DB00770	Alprostadil	Erectile Dysfunction (ED)/Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)/Raynaud's Phenomenon	Alprostadil is produced endogenously and causes vasodilation by means of a direct effect on vascular and ductus arteriosus (DA) smooth muscle, preventing or reversing the functional closure of the DA that occurs shortly after birth. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants. In infants, it is used for palliative, not definitive, therapy to temporarily maintain the patency of the ductus arteriosus until corrective or palliative surgery can be performed in neonates who have congenital heart defects and who depend upon the patent ductus for survival. In adults, it is used for the treatment of erectile dysfunction due to neurogenic, vasculogenic, psychogenic, or mixed etiology.
754	DB00771	Clidinium	Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)/Peptic Ulcer Disease/Acute Enterocolitis	Clidinium is a synthetic anticholinergic agent which has been shown in experimental and clinical studies to have a pronounced antispasmodic and antisecretory effect on the gastrointestinal tract. It inhibits muscarinic actions of acetylcholine at postganglionic parasympathetic neuroeffector sites. It is used for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease and also to help relieve abdominal or stomach spasms or cramps due to colicky abdominal pain, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel syndrome.

765	DB00783	Estradiol	Atrophic Vaginitis/Estrogen Deficiency/Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)/Postmenopausal Osteoporosis (PMO)/Vasomotor Symptoms/Vulvovaginal Atrophy/Advanced androgen dependent Prostate cancer/Contraception	"Estradiol (also known as E2 or 17β-estradiol) is a naturally occurring hormone that circulates endogenously within the human body. It is the most potent form of mammalian estrogenic steroids and acts as the major female sex hormone. As such, estradiol plays an essential role in the regulation of the menstrual cycle, in the development of puberty and secondary female sex characteristics, as well as in ageing and several hormonally-mediated disease states. Estrogen mediates its effects across the body through potent agonism of the Estrogen Receptor (ER), which is located in various tissues including in the breasts, uterus, ovaries, skin, prostate, bone, fat, and brain. Estradiol binds to both subtypes of the Estrogen Receptor: Estrogen Receptor Alpha (ERα) and Estrogen Receptor Beta (ERβ). Estradiol also acts as a potent agonist of G Protein-coupled Estrogen Receptor (GPER), which has recently been recognized as a major mediator of estradiol's rapid cellular effects . 
Estradiol is commercially available in several hormone therapy products for managing conditions associated with reduced estrogen production such as menopausal and peri-menopausal symptoms as well as hypoestrogenism. It is also used in transgender hormone therapy, as a component of oral contraceptive pills for preventing pregnancy (most commonly as DB00977, a synthetic form of estradiol), and is sometimes used for the palliative treatment of some hormone-sensitive cancers like breast and prostate cancer. Estradiol is available in a number of formulations including oral, transdermal, and injectable. 
The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. However, after menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone by peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women [FDA Label]. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol at the receptor level. Because of the difference in potency between estradiol and estrone, menopause (and a change in primary hormone from estradiol to estrone) is associated with a number of symptoms associated with this reduction in potency and in estrogenic effects. These include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood changes, irregular menses, chills, and sleeping problems.
When used for oral or IM administration, estradiol is commonly synthesized as a pro-drug ester (such as DB13952, DB13953, DB13954, DB13955, and DB13956). It is commonly produced with an ester side-chain as endogenous estradiol has very low oral bioavailability on its own (2-10%). First-pass metabolism by the gut and the liver quickly degrades the estradiol molecule before it gets a chance to enter the systemic circulation and exert its estrogenic effects . Esterification of estradiol aims to improve absorption after oral administration (such as with Estradiol valerate) or to sustain release from intramuscular depot injections (such as with Estradiol Cypionate) through improved lipophilicity . Following absorption, the esters are cleaved, resulting in the release of endogenous estradiol, or 17β-estradiol. 
Recommendations for treatment of menopausal symptoms changed drastically following the release of results and early termination of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies in 2002 as a number of concerns were raised regarding the use of estrogen . Specifically, the combined estrogen–progestin arm was discontinued after approximately five years of follow up due to a statistically significant increase in invasive breast cancer and in cardiovascular events . Following extensive critique of the WHI results in the years following its release, Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) is now recommended to be used only for a short period (for 3-5 years post-menopause) in low doses, and in women without a history of breast cancer or at increased risk of cardiovascular or thromboembolic disease . Notably, use of estrogen for menopausal symptoms should always be accompanied by a progestin component due to estrogen's effects on the endometrium; in women with an intact uterus, unopposed estrogen has been shown to promote the growth of the endometrium which can lead to endometrial hyperplasia and possibly cancer in the long-term. 
DB00977 (EE) is a synthetic form of estradiol commonly used as the estrogenic component of most combination Oral Contraceptive Pills (OCPs). Ethinyl Estradiol differs from Estradiol in that it has improved biovailability and greater resistance to metabolism, making it more suitable for oral administration."

778	DB00796	Candesartan cilexetil	Diabetic Nephropathies/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Migraine/Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA Class II)/Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA Class III)/Chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (NYHA Class IV)	Candesartan is an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) that may be used alone or with other agents to treat hypertension. It is administered orally as the prodrug, candesartan cilexetil, which is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, candesartan, during absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough. Candesartan may be used to treat hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy. It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease.
779	DB00797	Tolazoline		A vasodilator that apparently has direct actions on blood vessels and also increases cardiac output.

HCV is a single-stranded RNA virus that is categorized into nine distinct genotypes, with genotype 1 being the most common in the United States, and affecting 72% of all chronic HCV patients . It is reported that ribavirin might be only effective in early stages of viral hemorrhagic fevers including Lasser fever, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever, and Hantavirus infection. Ribavirin is a prodrug that is metabolized into nucleoside analogs that blocks viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. Before the development of newer drugs, ribavirin and DB00008/DB00022 dual therapy was considered the first-generation and standard antiviral treatment . The dual therapy was administered for 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1, 4, 5, and 6, and 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 and 3 . Newer drugs developed as Hepatitis C viral infection treatments can be used to reduce or eliminate the use of ribavirin, which are associated with serious adverse effects. They also improve therapeutic efficacy in patients with failed DB00008/DB00022 and ribavirin-based therapy. The potential use of ribavirin as a treatment for acute myeloid leukemia is currently under investigation.
According to 2017 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and 2015 consensus guidelines from the Canadian Association for the Study of the Liver (CASL), ribavirin is typically used as an adjunct therapy to various first-line and second-line combination therapies recommended for each genotypes. Ribavirin is added to decrease relapse rates by accelerating viral clearance early in the treatment course . When used to treat Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, it is always used as a part of combination therapies as ribavirin monotherapy is not efficacious in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection . Additionally, including ribavirin in the regimen can increase the risk of anemia. 
In HCV genotye 1/2/3/4/5/6 patients, ribavirin can be used in combination therapy involving DB09102 and DB08934, Eplusa (DB08934, DB11613), Harvoni (DB08934, DB09027), DB06290 and DB08934, Viekira Pak (DB09296, DB09297, DB00503, DB09183), Technivie (DB00503, DB09296, DB09297) and Zepatier (DB11574, DB11575). Addition of weight-based ribavirin to Technivie therapy increased sustained virologic response after 12 weeks of daily therapy (SVR12) from 90% to 97% in patients with HCV genotype 1a and 90.9% to 100% in HCV genotype 4 patients . Zepatier therapy along with ribavirin improved SVR in HCV genotype 5 patients. Combination therapy of ribavirin and DB00008 results in the SVR of 44% in patients with genotype 1 infection and 70% in patients with genotype 2-6. The inclusion of ribavirin in the combination therapies depend on individual patient's profile, for example if HCV genotype 3 patient has a Y93H genetic variant and compensated cirrhosis."
794	DB00812	Phenylbutazone		A drug that has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic activities. It is especially effective in the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis. It also is useful in rheumatoid arthritis and Reiter's syndrome (investigational indication).

IV administration of propfol is used to induce unconsciousness after which anaesthesia may be maintained using a combination of medications. Recovery from propofol-induced anaesthesia is generally rapid and associated with less frequent side effects (e.g. drowsiness, nausea, vomiting) than with thiopental, methohexital, and etomidate. Propofol may be used prior to diagnostic procedures requiring anaesthesia, in the management of refractory status epilepticus, and for induction and/or maintenance of anaesthesia prior to and during surgeries.
801	DB00819	Acetazolamide	Angle Closure Glaucoma/Familial periodic paralysis/Grand mal Generalized tonic-clonic seizure/Metabolic Alkalosis/Oedema/Open Angle Glaucoma (OAG)/Other and unspecified effects of high altitude/Cystine renal calculi/Drug-induced edema/Nonuveitic secondary glaucoma	One of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors that is sometimes effective against absence seizures. It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures, particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle. However, its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance. Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase, which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient, increased chloride current, and increased inhibition. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1991, p337)
802	DB00820	Tadalafil	Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)/Erectile Dysfunction (ED)/Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH)	"Tadalafil is an orally administered drug used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence). It is marketed worldwide under the brand name Cialis. It is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. Tadalafil's distinguishing pharmacologic feature is its longer half-life (17.5 hours) compared with Viagra and Levitra (4-5 hours). This longer half-life results in a longer duration of action and is, in part, responsible for the Cialis nickname of the ""weekend pill."" This longer half-life also is the basis of current investigation for tadalafil's use in pulmonary arterial hypertension as a once-daily therapy."
803	DB00821	Carprofen		Carprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used by veterinarians as a supportive treatment for the relief of arthritic symptoms in geriatric dogs.

Diflunisal possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. Though its mechanism of action has not been clearly established, most of its actions appear to be associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. Diflunisal is used to relieve pain accompanied with inflammation and in the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis.
844	DB00862	Vardenafil	Erectile Dysfunction (ED)	Vardenafil (Levitra) is an oral therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP.

It is also used in a topical preparation in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis, severe refractory uveitis after bone marrow transplants, and the skin condition vitiligo. It was discovered in 1984 from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus is chemically known as a macrolide. It reduces peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This FKBP12-FK506 complex inhibits calcineurin which inhibits T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription.

Conivaptan inhibits both isotypes of the vasopressin receptor (V1a and V2).
855	DB14596	Loteprednol etabonate	Ocular Pain/Ocular inflammatory conditions	"Loteprednol Etabonate (LE) is a topical corticoid anti-inflammatory. It is used in ophthalmic solution for the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the eye such as allergic conjunctivitis, uveitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and selected infective conjunctivitides. As a nasal spray, it can be used for the treatment and management of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
Most prescription LE products, however, tend to be indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation and pain following ocular surgery [FDA Label]. A number of such new formulations that have been approved include Kala Pharmaceutical's Inveltys - the first twice-daily (BID) ocular corticosteroid approved for this indication, designed specifically to enhance patient compliance and simplified dosing compared to all other similar ocular steroids that are dosed four times daily .
Moreover, LE was purposefully engineered to be a 'soft drug', one that is designed to be active locally at the site of administration and then rapidly metabolized to inactive components after eliciting its actions at the desired location, thereby subsequently minimizing the chance for adverse effects ."
856	DB00874	Guaifenesin	Phlegm/Chest congestion	"Guaifenesin possesses a storied history, having been originally formally approved by the US FDA in 1952 and continues to be one of very few - if not perhaps the only drug that is readily available and used as an expectorant . Since that time the agent has been a combination component of various prescription and non-prescription over-the-counter cough and cold products and is currently a widely available over-the-counter generic medication . Although it is principally believed that guaifenesin elicits an action to facilitate productive cough to manage chest congestion [A177661, L6100, F4516, F4522, F4525], it is not known whether the agent can reliably mitigate coughing.
Regardless, on March 1, 2007, the FDA received a petition asking the FDA to notify the public that some antitussives, expectorants, decongestants, antihistamines, and cough/cold combinations are not known to be safe and effective in children under the age of 6 years . After the negotiation between FDA and major manufacturers, a voluntary transition of labels for not using guaifenesin in children under the age of 4 years was endorsed by FDA in 2008 .
Furthermore, there has also been contemporary research to suggest that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist ."
857	DB00875	Flupentixol	Schizophrenic Disorders	Flupentixol is an antipsychotic neuroleptic drug. It is a thioxanthene, and therefore closely related to the phenothiazines.

Commonly formulated as oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), and injections, and available as generic products as well, ondansetron continues to see contemporary innovations in its formulation and use, including the development of orally soluble films that are both discreet in administration and less of a burden in comparison to having patients attempt to swallow pills during emesis ."
887	DB00905	Bimatoprost	Hypotrichosis of the eyelashes/Ocular Hypertension	Bimatoprost, also known as Latisse or Lumigan, belongs to a group of drugs called prostamides, which are synthetic structural analogs of prostaglandin. Bimatoprost, marketed by Allergan, is administered in an ophthalmic solution and has the ability to reduce ocular hypotension, proving effective in conditions such as ocular hypertension and glaucoma.[L6877,L6892,L6898] Bimatoprost is also used to treat eyelash hypotrichosis, or sparse eyelash growth. It was initially approved by the FDA in 2001 for ocular hypertension and later approved for hypothrichosis in 2008, as eyelash growth became a desirable adverse effect for patients using this drug.
888	DB00906	Tiagabine	Partial onset seizure Epilepsy	Tiagabine is an anti-convulsive medication. It is also used in the treatment for panic disorder as are a few other anticonvulsants. Though the exact mechanism by which tiagabine exerts its effect on the human body is unknown, it does appear to operate as a selective GABA reuptake inhibitor.
889	DB00907	Cocaine		An alkaloid ester extracted from the leaves of plants including coca. It is a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor and is clinically used for that purpose, particularly in the eye, ear, nose, and throat. It also has powerful central nervous system effects similar to the amphetamines and is a drug of abuse. Cocaine, like amphetamines, acts by multiple mechanisms on brain catecholaminergic neurons; the mechanism of its reinforcing effects is thought to involve inhibition of dopamine uptake.
890	DB00908	Quinidine	Atrial Fibrillation and Flutter/Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum/Pseudobulbar affect/Arrhythmia of ventricular origin	An optical isomer of quinine, extracted from the bark of the Cinchona tree and similar plant species. This alkaloid dampens the excitability of cardiac and skeletal muscles by blocking sodium and potassium currents across cellular membranes. It prolongs cellular action potential, and decreases automaticity. Quinidine also blocks muscarinic and alpha-adrenergic neurotransmission.
891	DB00909	Zonisamide	Partial onset seizure Epilepsy	Zonisamide is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant approved for use as an adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures. Zonisamide may be a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor although this is not one of the primary mechanisms of action. Zonisamide may act by blocking repetitive firing of voltage-gated sodium channels leading to a reduction of T-type calcium channel currents, or by binding allosterically to GABA receptors. This latter action may inhibit the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA while enhancing the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.
892	DB00910	Paricalcitol	Hyperparathyroidism, Secondary	Paricalcitol is a synthetic vitamin D analog. Paricalcitol has been used to reduce parathyroid hormone levels. Paricalcitol is indicated for the prevention and treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism associated with chronic renal failure.
893	DB00911	Tinidazole	Amebiasis/Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)/Giardiasis/Nongonococcal urethritis/Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD)/Trichomoniasis	A nitroimidazole antitrichomonal agent effective against Trichomonas vaginalis, Entamoeba histolytica, and Giardia lamblia infections.
894	DB00912	Repaglinide	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Repaglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity. Approximately 90% of a single orally administered dose is eliminated in feces and 8% in urine.
895	DB00913	Anileridine		Anileridine is a synthetic opioid and strong analgesic medication. It is a narcotic pain reliever used to treat moderate to severe pain. Narcotic analgesics act in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of their side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS.
896	DB00914	Phenformin		A biguanide hypoglycemic agent with actions and uses similar to those of metformin. Although it is generally considered to be associated with an unacceptably high incidence of lactic acidosis, often fatal, it is still available in some countries. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p290)
897	DB00915	Amantadine	Cerebral Arteriosclerosis/Chorea/Extrapyramidal disorder caused by neuroleptic drugs without Tardive dyskinesia/Influenza A Virus Infection/Parkinson's Disease (PD)/Parkinsonism/Parkinsonism post encephalitic/Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)/Tiredness	An antiviral that is used in the prophylactic or symptomatic treatment of influenza A. It is also used as an antiparkinsonian agent, to treat extrapyramidal reactions, and for postherpetic neuralgia. The mechanisms of its effects in movement disorders are not well understood but probably reflect an increase in synthesis and release of dopamine, with perhaps some inhibition of dopamine uptake.
898	DB00916	Metronidazole	Abscess, Intra-Abdominal/Acne Rosacea/Amebiasis/Anaerobic Infection/Bacteremia/Bacterial Infection Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori)/Bacterial Vaginosis (BV)/Balantidiasis/Bloodstream Infections/Bone and Joint Infections/Brain abscess/CNS Infection/Clostridium Difficile Infection (CDI)/Empyema/Endocarditis, Bacterial/Endometritis/Endomyometritis/Giardiasis/Gynaecological infection/Infection, Bacteroides/Intraabdominal Infections/Lower Respiratory Infection/Lower respiratory tract infection bacterial/Lung Abscess/Meningitis/Parasitic infection NOS/Periodontitis/Peritonitis bacterial/Pneumonia/Postoperative Infections/Pouchitis/Septicemia bacterial anaerobic/Skin Structures and Soft Tissue Infections/Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Bacterial Infections/Tetanus/Tubo-ovarian abscess/Urethritis/Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis/Entamoeba histolytica/Hepatic abscess/Refractory Sinusitis/Symptomatic Trichomoniasis/Asymptomatic Infections	Metronidazole is a commonly used antibiotic, belonging to the nitroimidazole class of antibiotics. It is frequently used to treat gastrointestinal infections as well as trichomoniasis and giardiasis, and amebiasis which are parasitic infections.[A181036,A18039] Metronidazole has been used as an antibiotic for several decades , with added antiparasitic properties that set it apart from many other antibacterial drugs, allowing it to treat a wide variety of infections. It is available in capsule form, tablet form, and topical form, and suppository preparations for the treatment of various infections.
899	DB00917	Dinoprostone	Gestational Trophoblastic Disease/Induction of cervix ripening therapy/Medically induced abortion therapy/Uterus evacuation	Dinoprostone is a naturally occurring prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It has important effects in labour. It also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimualtes bone resorption by osteoclasts. As a prescription drug it is used as a vaginal suppository, to prepare the cervix for labour and to induce labour.
900	DB00918	Almotriptan	Migraine	Almotriptan is a triptan drug for the treatment of migraine headaches. Almotriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Almotriptan does not prevent migraine attacks.
901	DB00919	Spectinomycin		An antibiotic produced by Streptomyces spectabilis. It is active against gram-negative bacteria and used for the treatment of gonorrhea.
902	DB00920	Ketotifen	Asthma, Allergic/Conjunctivitis, Seasonal Allergic	A cycloheptathiophene blocker of histamine H1 receptors and release of inflammatory mediators. It has been proposed for the treatment of asthma, rhinitis, skin allergies, and anaphylaxis.
903	DB00921	Buprenorphine	Opioid Dependence/Severe Pain/Moderate Pain	"Buprenorphine is a weak partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and a weak kappa-opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of severe pain.[A186283,A186292] It is also commonly used as an alternative to methadone for the treatment of severe opioid addiction.[F4715,F4718] Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with naloxone, a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and therefore has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,F4715,F4718] Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.
Buprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids. For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over methadone (which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation,[A186271,A186274] fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects, and an improved safety profile.[A186263,A186266,A186269]
Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as heroin, oxycodone, or methadone. This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the ""ceiling effect"" where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to methadone and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours. Treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine, methadone, or slow-release oral morphine (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as heroin or fentanyl. Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis."
904	DB00922	Levosimendan		Levosimendan increases calcium sensitivity to myocytes by binding to troponin C in a calcium dependent manner. This increases contractility without raising calcium levels. It also relaxes vascular smooth muscle by opening adenosine triphosphate sensitive potassium channels. Levosimendan is used to manage acutely decompensated congestive heart failure.
905	DB00923	Ceforanide		Ceforanide is administered parenterally. It has a longer elimination half-life than any currently available cephalosporin. Its activity is very similar to that of cefamandole, another second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic, except that ceforanide is less active against most gram-positive organisms. Many coliforms, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, and Proteus, are susceptible to ceforanide, as are most strains of Salmonella, Shigella, Hemophilus, Citrobacter and Arizona species.
906	DB00924	Cyclobenzaprine	Muscle Spasms	Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961 and has been available for human use since 1977. It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from Amitriptyline by only a single double bond.[A185039,A184982] Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury.
907	DB00925	Phenoxybenzamine	Micturition Disorder/Pheochromocytomas/Urinary Retention	An alpha-adrenergic antagonist with long duration of action. It has been used to treat hypertension and as a peripheral vasodilator. [PubChem]
908	DB00926	Etretinate		Etretinate is a medication used to treat severe psoriasis. It is a synthetic aromatic retinoid. The mechanism of action of etretinate is still incompletely understood although, like retinoic acid, it is thought to interfere with the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes. It is thought to bind to the retinoic acid receptors. Etretinate is also believed to enhance the binding of cAMP to the regulatory RI subunit of cAMP dependent protein kinases. Etretinate was taken off the market in Canada in 1996 and America in 1998 due to the risk of birth defects. Etretinate is now used to treat T-cell lymphomas. It also appears to inhibit NADH oxidase activity.
909	DB00927	Famotidine	Bacterial Infection Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori)/Duodenal Ulcer/Gastritis/Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)/Heartburn/Stress Ulcers/Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome/Acute Duodenal Ulcers/Acute benign gastric ulcers/Hypersecretory conditions/Multiple endocrine adenomas	A competitive histamine H2-receptor antagonist.

This modification prevents the formation of 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkages, which are needed for the elongation of DNA chains, thus resulting in the termination of viral DNA growth. The compound is a potent inhibitor of HIV replication at low concentrations, acting as a chain-terminator of viral DNA by binding to reverse transcriptase. Its principal toxic side effect is axonal degeneration resulting in peripheral neuropathy.
926	DB00944	Demecarium		Demecarium is an indirect-acting parasympathomimetic agent that is used to treat glaucoma. It is a cholinesterase inhibitor or an anticholinesterase. Cholinesterase inhibitors prolong the effect of acetylcholine, which is released at the neuroeffector junction of parasympathetic postganglion nerves, by inactivating the cholinesterases that break it down. Demecarium inactivates both pseudocholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase. In the eye, this causes constriction of the iris sphincter muscle (causing miosis) and the ciliary muscle. The outflow of the aqueous humor is facilitated, which leads to a reduction in intraocular pressure.

The discovery and research of this drug began in the early 1990's, where intravenous administration of radio-labelled compound in rats resulting in subsequent localization of the drug within enterocytes at the intestinal villus, leading to studies of investigating the effect of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol absorption . Ezetimibe is used as an adjunctive therapy to diet to lower cholesterol levels in primary hyperlipidemia, mixed hyperlipidemia, homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), and homozygous sitosterolemia (phytosterolemia) [FDA Label].
Unlike other classes of cholesterol-reducing compounds including statins and bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe has a distinct mechanism of action involving the sterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1), and is the first drug that does not affect absorption of fat-soluble nutrients such as fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids . In genetically NPC1L1-deficient mice, a 70% reduction in intestinal cholesterol absorption was seen and the mice were insensitive to ezetimibe treatment . Based on these findings, it is indicated that NPC1L1 plays an essential role in promoting intestinal cholesterol uptake via an ezetimibe-sensitive pathway . By interfering with the intestinal uptake of cholesterol and phytosterols, ezetimibe reduces the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver [FDA Label]."

On hydrolysis it yields neamine and neobiosamine B. (From Merck Index, 11th ed). Neomycin is a bactericidal aminoglycoside antibiotic that binds to the 30S ribosome of susceptible organisms. Binding interferes with mRNA binding and acceptor tRNA sites and results in the production of non-functional or toxic peptides.
977	DB00995	Auranofin	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Auranofin is a gold salt that is capable of eliciting pharmacologic actions that suppress inflammation and stimulate cell-mediated immunity. It has subsequently been listed by the World Health Organization as a member of the antirheumatic agent category. Auranofin appears to induce heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) mRNA. Heme oxygenase 1 is an inducible heme-degrading enzyme with anti-inflammatory properties.
978	DB00996	Gabapentin	Peripheral Neuropathic Pain/Postherpetic Neuralgia/Partial onset seizure Epilepsy	Gabapentin is a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) that was first approved for use in the United States in 1993. It was originally developed as a novel anti-epileptic for the treatment of certain types of seizures[A186277,A186143] - today it is also widely used to treat neuropathic pain.[A14097,A186179] Gabapentin has some stark advantages as compared with other anti-epileptics, such as a relatively benign adverse effect profile, wide therapeutic index, and lack of appreciable metabolism making it unlikely to participate in pharmacokinetic drug interactions.[A186143,A185981,L8717]. It is structurally and functionally related to another GABA derivative, pregabalin.
979	DB00997	Doxorubicin	Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemias (ALL)/Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia/Advanced Endometrial Cancer/Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma/Bladder transitional cell carcinoma/Carcinoma, Bronchogenic/Gastric Carcinoma/Kaposi's Sarcoma AIDS Related/Lymphoma, Hodgkins/Malignant Lymphomas/Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)/Multiple Myeloma (MM)/Mycosis Fungoides (MF)/Neuroblastomas/Ovarian Cancer Metastatic/Ovarian Carcinoma/Sarcoma, Bone/Sezary Syndrome/Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS)/Thyroid Carcinoma/Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia (WM)/Wilms' tumor/Advanced Thymoma/Advanced uterine sarcoma	Doxorubicin is a cytotoxic anthracycline antibiotic isolated from cultures of Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius.

It is indicated to treat edema and hypertension.[A185138,L8447,L8450] Hydrochlorothiazide use is common but declining in favour of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Many combination products are available containing hydrochlorothiazide and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors[L8390,L8423] or angiotensin II receptor blockers.[L7426,L7459]
Hydrochlorothiazide was granted FDA approval on 12 February 1959."
982	DB01000	Cyclacillin		A cyclohexylamido analog of penicillanic acid.
983	DB01001	Salbutamol	Bronchospasm/Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB)/Hyperkalemia	Salbutamol is a short-acting, selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.[Label,A174379,A174400]
984	DB01002	Levobupivacaine		"Levobupivacaine is an amino-amide local anaesthetic drug belonging to the family of n-alkylsubstituted
pipecoloxylidide. It is the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Chirocaine. In particular, the specific levobupivacaine enantiomer is a worthwhile pursuit because it demonstrates less vasodilation and possesses a greater length of action in comparison to bupivacaine. It is approximately 13 per cent less potent (by molarity) than racemic bupivacaine.Levobupivacaine is indicated for local anaesthesia including infiltration, nerve block, ophthalmic, epidural and intrathecal anaesthesia in adults; and infiltration analgesia in children. When administered appropriately, the occurrence of adverse effects is not anticipated much if at all. In general, the majority of potential adverse effects are predominantly associated with inappropriate administration methods that may cause systemic exposure and/or toxicity associated with overexposure to an anesthetic. Regardless, allergic reactions may also occur - although only rarely."

988	DB01006	Letrozole	Advanced Breast Cancer/Anovulatory cycle/Ovarian Epithelial Cancer/Stage I Breast Carcinoma/Advanced HR + HER2 - breast cancer/Metastatic HR + HER2 - breast cancer	"Letrozole (INN, trade name Femara®) is an oral non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor that has been introduced for the adjuvant treatment of hormonally-responsive breast cancer
Estrogens are produced by the conversion of androgens through the activity of the aromatase enzyme. Letrozole blocks the production of estrogens in this way by competitive, reversible binding to the heme of its cytochrome P450 unit. It is important to note that letrozole does not decrease the production of mineralocorticoids or corticosteroids. In contrast, the antiestrogenic action of tamoxifen, the major medical therapy prior to the arrival of aromatase inhibitors, is due to its interfering with the estrogen receptor, rather than inhibiting estrogen production.
 Side effects include signs and symptoms of hypoestrogenism. There is concern that long term use may lead to osteoporosis, which is why prescriptions of Letrozole are often accompanied by prescriptions of osteoporosis-fighting medication such as Fosamax.
Letrozole has shown to reduce estrogen levels by 98 percent while raising testosterone levels. The anti-estrogen action of letrozole is preferred by athletes and bodybuilders for use during a steroid cycle to reduce bloating due to excess water retention and prevent the formation of gynecomastia related breast tissue that is a side effect of some anabolic steroids. Usage above 2.5 mg/day is known to potentially temporarily kill sex drive. Above 5mg/day for extended periods may cause kidney problems.
Letrozole has also been shown to delay the fusing of the growth plates in adolescents. This may boost the effectiveness of growth hormone, and thus Letrozole is used to treat adolescents and children with short stature."
989	DB01007	Tioconazole	Vulvovaginal Candidiasis	"Tioconazole is an imidazole antifungal used to treat fungal and yeast infections. Topical formulations are used for ringworm, jock itch, athlete's foot, and tinea versicolor or ""sun fungus"". Tioconazole interacts with 14-alpha demethylase, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that converts lanosterol to ergosterol, an essential component of the yeast membrane. In this way, tioconazole inhibits ergosterol synthesis, resulting in increased cellular permeability."

1000	DB01018	Guanfacine	Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)/Gilles de la Tourette's Syndrome/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Migraine	A centrally acting antihypertensive agent. The drug lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by activating the central nervous system alpha-2 adrenoreceptors, which results in reduced sympathetic outflow leading to reduced vascular tone. Its adverse reactions include dry mouth, sedation, and constipation.
1001	DB01019	Bethanechol	Neurogenic Bladder Dysfunction/Postoperative Urinary Retention/Postpartum urinary retention	Bethanechol is a synthetic ester structurally and pharmacologically related to acetylcholine. A slowly hydrolyzed muscarinic agonist with no nicotinic effects, bethanechol is generally used to increase smooth muscle tone, as in the GI tract following abdominal surgery or in urinary retention in the absence of obstruction. It may cause hypotension, cardiac rate changes, and bronchial spasms.
1002	DB01020	Isosorbide mononitrate	Angina Pectoris	"Isosorbide mononitrate is a drug used principally in the treatment of angina pectoris and acts by dilating the blood vessels so as to reduce the blood pressure. It is sold by AstraZeneca under the trade name Imdur.
Isosorbide mononitrate is used to for the the prophylactic treatment of angina pectoris; that is, it is taken in order to prevent or at least reduce the occurrence of angina. Research on Isosorbide mononitrate as a cervical ripener to reduce time at hospital to birth is supportive.
Isosorbide mononitrate is an active metabolite of isosorbide dinitrate and exerts qualitatively similar effects. Isosorbide mononitrate reduces the workload of the heart by producing venous and arterial dilation. By reducing the end diastolic pressure and volume, isosorbide mononitrate lowers intramural pressure, hence leading to an improvement in the subendocardial blood flow. The net effect when administering isosorbide mononitrate is therefore a reduced workload for the heart and an improvement in the oxygen supply/demand balance of the myocardium.
The adverse reactions which follow have been reported in studies with isosorbide mononitrate:
Very common. Up to 30% of patients experience headaches and 2-3 % of patients withdraw treatment for this reason, but the incidence reduces rapidly as treatment continues .
Common. 6% of patients experience tiredness, sleep disturbances, and gastrointestinal disturbances. 4-5% of patients experience hypotension, 2.5% experience poor appetite, and 1% experience nausea.
Patients experience similar adverse effects as they would for all nitrate treatments and their incidence is most common early in treatment. These symptoms generally disappear during long-term treatment.
Other reactions that have been reported with isosorbide mononitrate modified release tablets include tachycardia, vomiting, diarrhoea, vertigo and heartburn"
1003	DB01021	Trichlormethiazide		A thiazide diuretic with properties similar to those of hydrochlorothiazide. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p830)

Vitamin K is needed for the posttranslational modification of certain proteins, mostly required for blood coagulation.
1005	DB01023	Felodipine	High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)	Felodipine is a long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB)b. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, felodipine prevents calcium-dependent myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. Felodipine is the most potent CCB in use and is unique in that it exhibits fluorescent activity. In addition to binding to L-type calcium channels, felodipine binds to a number of calcium-binding proteins, exhibits competitive antagonism of the mineralcorticoid receptor, inhibits the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and blocks calcium influx through voltage-gated T-type calcium channels. Felodipine is used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.
1006	DB01024	Mycophenolic acid	Kidney Transplant Rejection	Mycophenolic acid is an an immunosuppresant drug and potent anti-proliferative, and can be used in place of the older anti-proliferative azathioprine. It is usually used as part of triple therapy including a calcineurin inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and prednisolone. It is also useful in research for the selection of animal cells that express the E. coli gene coding for XGPRT (xanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase).

1029	DB01049	Ergoloid mesylate	Mental activity decreased	Ergoloid Mesylate is an equiproportional preparation of three different ergotamantriones: dihydroergocornine, dihydroergocristine, and dihydroergocryptine. All these components are produced by the fungus Claviceps purpurea and are all derivatives of the tetracyclic compound 6-methylergonovine. The derivatives of this fungus are identified to be about 350 different substances from which the components of the ergoloid mesylate mixture are composed of the dihydrogenated ergot alkaloid derivatives. The mixture of ergoloid mesylate was first developed by Novartis and FDA approved on November 5, 1953, but this specific formulation is now discontinued. Later in 1991, the mixture of ergoloid mesylates was retaken by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and approved by the FDA. To know more about the individual components of the ergoloid mixture, please visit DB11275, DB11274, DB11273 and DB13345.

The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin. Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID. On the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer in vivo by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.

It is a natural penicillin antibiotic that is administered intravenously or intramuscularly due to poor oral absorption. Penicillin G may also be used in some cases as prophylaxis against susceptible organisms.
Natural penicillins are considered the drugs of choice for several infections caused by susceptible gram positive aerobic organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, groups A, B, C and G streptococci, nonenterococcal group D streptococci, viridans group streptococci, and non-penicillinase producing staphylococcus. Aminoglycosides may be added for synergy against group B streptococcus (S. agalactiae), S. viridans, and Enterococcus faecalis. The natural penicillins may also be used as first or second line agents against susceptible gram positive aerobic bacilli such as Bacillus anthracis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. Natural penicillins have limited activity against gram negative organisms; however, they may be used in some cases to treat infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis and Pasteurella. They are not generally used to treat anaerobic infections. Resistance patterns, susceptibility and treatment guidelines vary across regions."

1044	DB01065	Melatonin	Sleeplessness	Melatonin is a biogenic amine that is found in animals, plants and microbes. Aaron B. Lerner of Yale University is credited for naming the hormone and for defining its chemical structure in 1958.  In mammals, melatonin is produced by the pineal gland. The pineal gland is small endocrine gland, about the size of a rice grain and shaped like a pine cone (hence the name), that is located in the center of the brain (rostro-dorsal to the superior colliculus) but outside the blood-brain barrier. The secretion of melatonin increases in darkness and decreases during exposure to light, thereby regulating the circadian rhythms of several biological functions, including the sleep-wake cycle. In particular, melatonin regulates the sleep-wake cycle by chemically causing drowsiness and lowering the body temperature.  Melatonin is also implicated in the regulation of mood, learning and memory, immune activity, dreaming, fertility and reproduction. Melatonin is also an effective antioxidant.  Most of the actions of melatonin are mediated through the binding and activation of melatonin receptors. Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) may have lower than normal levels of melatonin. A 2008 study found that unaffected parents of individuals with ASD also have lower melatonin levels, and that the deficits were associated with low activity of the ASMT gene, which encodes the last enzyme of melatonin synthesis. Reduced melatonin production has also been proposed as a likely factor in the significantly higher cancer rates in night workers.

It is commonly marketed under the trade name Spectracef by Cornerstone BioPharma.
1046	DB01067	Glipizide	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Glipizide is an oral hypoglycemic agent in the second-generation sulfonylurea drug class that is used to control blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. It was first introduced in 1984 and is available in various countries including Canada and the U.S. According to the 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines by Diabetes Canada, sulfonylurea drugs are considered a second-line glucose-lowering therapy following metformin. Because sulfonylureas require functional pancreatic beta cells for their therapeutic effectiveness, sulfonylureas are more commonly used for early-stage type 2 diabetes when there is no progressed pancreatic failure. Compared to the first-generation sulfonylureas, such as tolbutamide and chlorpropamide, second-generation sulfonylureas contain a more non-polar side chain in their chemical structure, which enhances their hypoglycemic potency. Compared to other members of the sulfonylurea drug group, glipizide displays rapid absorption and onset of action with the shortest half-life and duration of action, reducing the risk for long-lasting hypoglycemia that is often observed with blood glucose-lowering agents. Glipizide was first approved by the FDA in 1994 and is available in extended-release tablets under the brand name Glucotrol®, as well as in combination with metformin under the brand name Metaglip®.

The agent has also been indicated for treating panic disorder [FDA Label] [A175438, L5572, F3763, F3787, F3796]. The mechanism of action appears to involve the enhancement of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor responses [FDA Label] [A175438, A175441, L5572, F3763, F3787, F3796].
Since being first patented in 1960 and then released for sale from Roche in the US in 1975 [T469, T472], clonazepam has experienced a storied history in the treatment of the aforementioned medical conditions. Now available as a generic medication, the agent continues to see exceptionally high use as millions of prescriptions are written for the medication internationally every year. Unfortunately, however, like most benzodiazepines, clonazepam use has also been associated with recreational use and drug abuse [FDA Label] [L5572, F3763, F3787, F3796]."

Like other antiretrovirals, it is used to treat infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Atazanavir is distinguished from other PIs in that it can be given once-daily (rather than requiring multiple doses per day) and has lesser effects on the patient's lipid profile (the amounts of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood). Like other protease inhibitors, it is used only in combination with other HIV medications. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atazanavir on June 20, 2003.

However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties [L5269, F3352]. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for ""night time"" use [L5263, L5281, L5287]. 
Diphenhydramine is also used in combination with DB14132 as the anti-nausea drug DB00985 where it is utilized primarily for its antagonism of H1 histamine receptors within the vestibular system .
Diphenhydramine has also been shown to be implicated in a number of neurotransmitter systems that affect behaviour including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and opioid . As a result, diphenhydramine is being investigated for its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties."

By inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol within the liver, statins lower abnormal cholesterol and lipid levels and ultimately reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]
Atorvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, and simvastatin are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world. Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with &lt;10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]
While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while atorvastatin has been found to have about one-third of that potency.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as atorvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as pravastatin and rosuvastatin which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181438, A181427]
Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996. It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound. Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation."

1058	DB01079	Tegaserod	Constipation-predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS-C)	"Novartis' brand name Zelnorm (tegaserod) had originally received approval from the US FDA in 2002 for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) [L5918, F4229]. It was, however, voluntarily withdrawn from widespread use in the US market in 2007 after concerns arose over the possibility that tegaserod could potentially cause dangerous cardiovascular events in patients [L5918, F4229]. Since then, closer evaluations of the original data suggesting such cardiovascular risk have resulted in the limited reintroduction or 're-approval' of tegaserod for treatment of IBS-C specifically in female patients less than 65 years of age and whom are considered to be at a lower risk of a cardiovascular event than the broader population [L5918, F4229]. Zelnorm (tegaserod) by Sloan Pharma subsequently gained re-approval in April of 2019 . Nevertheless, tegaserod remains un-approved in certain regions .
Despite the relative complications involved in its history of regulatory approval, ever since its first introduction in 2002 tegaserod remains the only therapy for IBS-C that possesses the unique mechanism of action of acting on serotonin-4 (5-HT(4)) receptors in smooth muscle cells and in the gastrointestinal wall to facilitate actions like esophageal relaxation, peristaltic gut movement, and natural secretions in the gut, among others [L5918, A11044, A176762, F4229, F4223]."

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]
Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world. Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with &lt;10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]
While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than atorvastatin's effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.
Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system. This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin, which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs. Drugs such as ciclosporin, gemfibrozil, and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]"

Despite marked structural differences between compounds in this drug class, SSRIs exert similar pharmacological effects. Several weeks of therapy with sertraline may be required before beneficial effects are noticed. Sertraline displays enhanced safety or tolerability than other classes of antidepressants, which frequently cause high levels of drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and other undesirable effects.[A1846,A187075,T28]
1084	DB01105	Sibutramine		Sibutramine (trade name Meridia in the USA, Reductil in Europe and other countries), usually as sibutramide hydrochloride monohydrate, is an orally administered agent for the treatment of obesity. It is a centrally acting stimulant chemically related to amphetamines thus it is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. In October 2010, Sibutramine was withdrawn from Canadian and U.S. markets due to concerns that the drug increases the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with a history of heart disease.
1085	DB01106	Levocabastine	Allergic Rhinitis (AR)	Levocabastine is a selective second-generation H1-receptor antagonist used for allergic conjunctivitis. Levocabastine was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1979.
1086	DB01107	Methyprylon		Methyprylon is a sedative of the piperidinedione derivative family that was previously used for the treatment of insomnia. However, with the introduction of newer drugs with fewer side effects, such as benzodiazepines, the clinical use of methyprylon is now limited. Methyprylon was withdrawn from the U.S. market in June 1965 and the Canadian market in September 1990 due to adverse events.
1087	DB01108	Trilostane		Trilostane is an inhibitor of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase used in the treatment of Cushing's syndrome. It was withdrawn from the United States market in April 1994.

It is a naturally occurring anticoagulant released from mast cells. It binds reversibly to antithrombin III (ATIII) and greatly accelerates the rate at which ATIII inactivates coagulation enzymes thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. UH is different from low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the following ways: the average molecular weight of LMWH is about 4.5 kDa whereas it is 15 kDa for UH; UH requires continuous infusions; activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT) monitoring is required when using UH; and UH has a higher risk of bleeding and higher risk of osteoporosis in long term use. Unfractionated heparin is more specific than LMWH for thrombin. Furthermore, the effects of UH can typically be reversed by using protamine sulfate.

It has been proposed for infections with gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, gonorrhea, and haemophilus.
1092	DB01113	Papaverine		An alkaloid found in opium but not closely related to the other opium alkaloids in its structure or pharmacological actions. It is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used in the treatment of impotence and as a vasodilator, especially for cerebral vasodilation. The mechanism of its pharmacological actions is not clear, but it apparently can inhibit phosphodiesterases and it may have direct actions on calcium channels.
1093	DB01114	Chlorpheniramine	Allergic Rhinitis (AR)/Allergies/Coughing/Pollen Allergy/Upper respiratory symptoms	A histamine H1 antagonist used in allergic reactions, hay fever, rhinitis, urticaria, and asthma. It has also been used in veterinary applications. One of the most widely used of the classical antihistaminics, it generally causes less drowsiness and sedation than promethazine.
1094	DB01115	Nifedipine	Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Hypertensive Emergency/Premature Labour/Pulmonary Edemas/Pulmonary Hypertension (PH)/Raynaud's Phenomenon/Ureteral Calculus/Vasospastic Angina	Nifedipine has been formulated as both a long- and short-acting 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nifedipine prevents calcium-dependent myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. A second proposed mechanism for the drug’s vasodilatory effects involves pH-dependent inhibition of calcium influx via inhibition of smooth muscle carbonic anhydrase. Nifedipine is used to treat hypertension and chronic stable angina.
1095	DB01116	Trimethaphan		A nicotinic antagonist that has been used as a ganglionic blocker in hypertension, as an adjunct to anesthesia, and to induce hypotension during surgery.

It is being used in antimalarial protocols.
1097	DB01118	Amiodarone	Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation/Tachycardia, Supraventricular/Recurrent Ventricular fibrillation/Recurrent hemodynamically unstable Ventricular tachycardia	Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug used in a variety of settings.
1098	DB01119	Diazoxide	Hyperinsulinemic Hypoglycemia	A benzothiadiazine derivative that is a peripheral vasodilator used for hypertensive emergencies. It lacks diuretic effect, apparently because it lacks a sulfonamide group.
1099	DB01120	Gliclazide	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Gliclazide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It has been classified differently according to its drug properties in which based on its chemical structure, gliclazide is considered a first-generation sulfonylurea due to the structural presence of a sulfonamide group able to release a proton and the presence of one aromatic group. On the other hand, based on the pharmacological efficacy, gliclazide is considered a second-generation sulfonylurea which presents a higher potency and a shorter half-life.[T238, T360] Gliclazide belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Gliclazide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Gliclazide is extensively metabolized by the liver; its metabolites are excreted in both urine (60-70%) and feces (10-20%).

1102	DB01123	Proflavine		3,6-Diaminoacridine. Topical antiseptic used mainly in wound dressings.
1103	DB01124	Tolbutamide	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Tolbutamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It is structurally similar to acetohexamide, chlorpropamide and tolazamide and belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Tolbutamide appears to be metabolized in the liver. Tolbutamide and its metabolites are excreted in urine (75-85%) and feces.
1104	DB01125	Anisindione		Anisindione is a synthetic anticoagulant and an indanedione derivative. Its anticoagulant action is mediated through the inhibition of the vitamin K-mediated gamma-carboxylation of precursor proteins that are critical in forming the formation of active procoagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X, as well as the anticoagulant proteins C and S, in the liver.
1105	DB01126	Dutasteride	Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)/Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia	Dutasteride is an oral synthetic 4-azasteroid commonly marketed under the trade name Avodart. It is a novel dual 5α-reductase inhibitor that works by blocking both isoforms of 5α-reductase enzymes in a potent, selective, and irreversible manner. Type I and II 5α-reductase enzymes convert testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a primary hormonal mediator that plays a role in the development and enlargement of the prostate gland. Dutasteride was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men as monotherapy or in combination with the α-adrenergic antagonist tamsulosin to enhance the therapeutic response. Its clinical efficacy against benign prostate hyperplasia in male patients is comparable to that of finasteride, a specific type II 5α-reductase inhibitor. However, unlike finasteride, dutasteride is not yet indicated for the treatment of androgenic alopecia although it was demonstrated to be effective in several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in androgenetic alopecia.[A178333,A178336]
1106	DB01127	Econazole	Candidiasis, Cutaneous/Pityriasis versicolor/Tinea Corporis/Tinea Cruris/Tinea Pedis/Tinea pedis of the interdigital	A broad spectrum antimycotic with some action against Gram positive bacteria. It is used topically in dermatomycoses also orally and parenterally.
1107	DB01128	Bicalutamide	Stage D2 Prostatic carcinoma	Bicalutamide is an oral non-steroidal anti-androgen for prostate cancer. It is comprised of a racemic mixture that is a 50:50 composition of the (R)-bicalutamide and (S)-bicalutamide enantionmers. Bicalutamide binds to the androgen receptor.
1108	DB01129	Rabeprazole	Bacterial Infection Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H. Pylori)/Duodenal Ulcer/Gastric Ulcer (GU)/Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)/Heartburn/NSAID Associated Gastric Ulcers/Non-erosive Reflux Disease (NERD)/Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome	Rabeprazole is an antiulcer drug in the class of proton pump inhibitors. It is a prodrug - in the acid environment of the parietal cells it turns into active sulphenamide form. Rabeprazole inhibits the H+, K+ATPase of the coating gastric cells and dose-dependent oppresses basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion.
1109	DB01130	Prednicarbate	Dermatosis	Prednicarbate is a relatively new topical corticosteroid drug that displays a similar potency as hydrocortisone. It is used in the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis. It has a favorable benefit-risk ratio, with an inflammatory action similar to that of a medium potency corticosteroid, but with a low potential to cause skin atrophy. The anti-inflammation action of corticosteroids is associated with the inhibition of the interleukin 1-alpha cytokine within keratinocytes. IL-1a is also found in fibroblasts, where it is responsible for proliferation, collagenase induction and IL-6 synthesis, which are related to skin thickness.
1110	DB01131	Proguanil	Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum/Acute, uncomplicated Malaria caused by plasmodium falciparum	Proguanil is a prophylactic antimalarial drug, which works by stopping the malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax, from reproducing once it is in the red blood cells. It does this by inhibiting the enzyme, dihydrofolate reductase, which is involved in the reproduction of the parasite.
1111	DB01132	Pioglitazone	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Pioglitazone is a medication belonging to the thiazolidinedione class of drugs that are used as adjuncts to diet, exercise, and other diabetes medications to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. The thiazolidinedione class of medications exerts its pharmacological effect primarily by promoting insulin sensitivity and the improved uptake of blood glucose. Following entry into fat cell nuclei, pioglitazone selectively binds to the Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma (PPARγ) . PPARs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are involved in the expression of more than 100 genes, and affect numerous metabolic processes, notably lipid and glucose homeostasis . PPARγ in particular is abundantly expressed in lipid cells (adipocytes), where it plays a central role in lipid production and regulation of lipid metabolism.

1120	DB01141	Micafungin	Abscesses/Aspergillosis/Candidemia/Esophageal Candidiasis/Infections, Fungal/Peritonitis/Disseminated Candidiasis/Prophylaxis of Candida Infections	Micafungin is an antifungal drug. It belongs to the antifungal class of compounds known as echinocandins and exerts its effect by inhibiting the synthesis of 1,3-beta-D-glucan, an integral component of the fungal cell wall.
1121	DB01142	Doxepin	Anxiety/Bipolar Affective Disorders/Depression/Depression, Involutional/Lichen simplex chronicus/Neurotic depression/Pain, Neuropathic/Pruritus/Sleeplessness/Psychotic depressive disorder	Doxepin is a psychotropic agent with tricyclic antidepressant and anxiolytic properties. It is a tertiary amine that can be presented as an (E) and (Z) stereoisomers from which the (Z) form corresponds to cidoxepin. The common products for doxepin included a racemic mixture 5:1 (E):(Z). In a strict sense, doxepin is not a tricyclic antidepressant but it is commonly associated with them as it shares a lot of properties with some of the members of this family such as amitriptyline, clomipramine, desipramine, imipramine, nortriptyline, protriptyline and trimipramine. Doxepin was developed by Pfizer and FDA approved initially in 1969 as an antidepressive. However, in 2010 it was approved for the treatment of insomnia. This later indication was presented by Pernix Therapeutics.

Its therapeutic usefulness and its mechanism of action are not clear. It may have local anesthetic activity and direct relaxing effects on smooth muscle as well as some activity as a muscarinic antagonist. [PubChem]
1128	DB01149	Nefazodone	Depression	Nefazodone hydrochloride (trade name Serzone) is an antidepressant drug marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Its sale was discontinued in 2003 in some countries, due to the small possibility of hepatic (liver) injury. Drug-induced hepatic injuries were associated with an risk of elevated need for a liver transplant, or even death, with the incidence of severe liver damage was shown to be approximately 1 in 250,000 to 300,000 patient-years. On May 20, 2004, Bristol-Myers Squibb discontinued the sale of Serzone in the United States.
1129	DB01150	Cefprozil	Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB)/Bacterial Infections/Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)/Otitis media bacterial/Streptococcal Pharyngitis/Streptococcal tonsillitis/Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)/Uncomplicated skin and subcutaneous tissue bacterial infections	Cefprozil is a cephalosporin antibiotic that is commonly employed to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including those of the ear and skin, bronchitis, and others.
1130	DB01151	Desipramine	Anorexia Nervosa (AN)/Bulimia Nervosa (BN)/Depression/Diabetic Neuropathies/Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)/Pain, Chronic/Pain, Neuropathic/Panic Disorders/Postherpetic Neuralgia/Sleeplessness	Desipramine hydrochloride is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, desipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine and nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and doxepine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical β-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H1 receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. Desipramine may be used to treat depression, neuropathic pain (unlabeled use), agitation and insomnia (unlabeled use) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (unlabeled use).

1135	DB01156	Bupropion	Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)/BMI >30 kg/m2/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD)/Cessation, Smoking/Obese experiencing rapid weight loss	"Bupropion (also known as the brand name product Wellbutrin®) is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) used most commonly for the management of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]
Bupropion was originally classified as an ""atypical"" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A198804] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]
When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Bupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response. Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD. When used in combination with naltrexone in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways. Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and naltrexone increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.[L6562,A179038,A179050] The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo."

[PubChem]
1150	DB01171	Moclobemide	Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)	A reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) selective for isoform A (RIMA) used to treat major depressive disorder. Most meta-analyses and most studies indicate that in the acute management of depression, moclobemide is more efficacious than placebo medication and similarly efficacious as tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  Due to negligible anticholinergic and antihistaminic actions, moclobemide has been better tolerated than tri- or heterocyclic antidepressants .

It promotes binding to inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid subtype receptors, and modulates chloride currents through receptor channels. It also inhibits glutamate induced depolarizations.
1154	DB01175	Escitalopram	Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)/Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)	Escitalopram is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) and the S-enantiomer of racemic Citalopram. It is used to restore serotonergic function in the treatment of depression and anxiety.[L8513,L8516,L8522] Escitalopram is approximately 150 times more potent than citalopram’s R-enantiomer and is responsible for the vast majority of citalopram’s clinical activity, with some evidence suggesting that the R-enantiomer of racemic citalopram actively dampens the activity of escitalopram rather than existing simply as an inactive enantiomer.[A39738,A185819] Amongst SSRIs, escitalopram exerts the highest degree of selectivity for the serotonin transporter (SERT) relative to other off-targets which may explain its lower rates of adverse effects as compared to other agents in this class. Escitalopram also differentiates itself from other SSRIs via allosteric action on its target - this may be the mechanism responsible for its observed superior efficacy and faster onset compared to other SSRIs.[A185825,A185726,A185822]

It also has weak beta-blocking activity. The drug is generally well tolerated.
1162	DB01183	Naloxone	Opioid Dependence/Opioid Overdose/Pruritis/Respiratory Depression/Severe Pain/Shock, Septic/Moderate Pain	"Naloxone is an opioid antagonist medication used to block or reverse the effects of opioid drugs, particularly within the setting of drug overdoses which are rapidly becoming a leading cause of death worldwide. More specifically, naloxone has a high affinity for μ-opioid receptors, where it acts as an inverse agonist, causing the rapid removal of any other drugs bound to these receptors. When taken in large quantities, opioid medications such as morphine, hydromorphone, methadone, heroin, or fentanyl are capable of causing life-threatening symptoms such as respiratory depression, reduced heart rate, slurred speech, drowsiness, and constricted pupils. If untreated, this can progress to vomiting, absent pulse and breathing, loss of consciousness, and even death. Naloxone is indicated for the rapid reversal of these symptoms of central nervous system depression in opioid overdose. It's important to note that naloxone only works on opioid receptors within the body, and is therefore not capable of reversing the effects of non-opioid medications such as stimulants like methamphetamine or cocaine, or benzodiazepines like lorazepam or diazepam. 
Also known as the brand name product Narcan, naloxone is currently available by intramuscular (IM) or subcutaneous (SubQ) injection, nasal spray, or intravenous (IV) infusion. Naloxone IM injections are commonly available in the form of ""kits"", which is ideal for making overdose treatment accessible and readily available for administration by minimally trained individuals within the community. Kits commonly include the supplies necessary to treat an overdose in a non-medical setting such as alcohol swabs, syringes, a rescue breathing mask, and instructions for use. Frequently also carried by medical and emergency personnel and at events known to be associated with heavy drug use like music festivals, naloxone kits are considered a key component of harm reduction strategies.
When injected intramuscularly (IM), naloxone acts within 3-5 minutes and can last from 30-60 minutes before its effects wear off. Administration of naloxone is associated with very few side effects. Notably, if injected into a person not currently using opioid medications, there would be no noticeable effects at all. However, for individuals using opioid medications or experiencing an overdose, IM injection of naloxone rapidly reverses opioid effects and can cause the injected individual to immediately experience withdrawal symptoms. Common symptoms of opioid withdrawal include nausea, vomiting, sweating, runny nose, aches, and diarrhea. Although certainly physically uncomfortable, opioid withdrawal symptoms are not life-threatening like they are for alcohol withdrawals. Administration of naloxone is therefore appropriate for any person appearing to have any symptoms of an opioid overdose. Due to its short duration of action, persons injected with naloxone should be monitored for responsiveness and potentially injected a second time or taken to the hospital.
Naloxone is also available within the combination product Suboxone with the opioid medication buprenorphine. Suboxone is used for the maintenance treatment of opioid dependence and addiction. When taken orally, naloxone has no pharmacological effect and does not reduce the effectiveness of the opioid effect of buprenorphine. The primary purpose of including naloxone within Suboxone is to act as a deterrent to injection, as injected naloxone would rapidly reverse the effects of buprenorphine."
1163	DB01184	Domperidone	Diabetic Gastroparesis/Gastrointestinal Symptoms/Upper gastrointestinal motility disorders	A specific blocker of dopamine receptors. It speeds gastrointestinal peristalsis, causes prolactin release, and is used as antiemetic and tool in the study of dopaminergic mechanisms.

1165	DB01186	Pergolide		Pergolide is a long-acting dopamine agonist approved in 1982 for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. It is an ergot derivative that acts on the dopamine D2 and D3, alpha2- and alpha1-adrenergic, and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. It was indicated as adjunct therapy with levodopa/carbidopa in the symptomatic treatment of parkinsonian syndrome. It was later found that pergolide increased the risk of cardiac valvulopathy. The drug was withdrawn from the US market in March 2007 and from the Canadian market in August 2007. While the use of pergolide in humans is still approved in only some countries, pergolide is mainly used for veterinary purposes.
1166	DB01187	Iophendylate		"Iophendylate is a mixture of isomers used as contrast medium, mainly for brain and spinal cord visualization. Iophendylate is a myelographic oil-ester (U.S. Patent 2,348,231). Iophendylate, which was never shown to be safe, was initially introduced for use in small amounts (1-2cc) for locating spinal tumors. It next appeared on the world scene for high volume (12-15cc), routine use, in diagnosing disc herniations. A number of clinicians have published on the dangers of oil myelography. In 1942 Van Wagenen (a neurosurgical colleague of Warrens, at the University of Rochester) identified Iophendylate as causing chemical meningitis in 30 patients where ""space-displacing masses within the spinal canal were suspected""."
1167	DB01188	Ciclopirox	Candidiasis, Cutaneous/Pityriasis versicolor/Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp/Tinea Corporis/Tinea Cruris/Tinea Pedis/Mild Onychomycosis/Moderate Onychomycosis	Ciclopirox olamine (used in preparations called Batrafen, Loprox, Mycoster, Penlac and Stieprox) is a synthetic antifungal agent for topical dermatologic treatment of superficial mycoses.

1168	DB01189	Desflurane	Maintenance of anesthesia therapy/Anesthesia induction and maintenance therapy	Desflurane is a highly fluorinated methyl ethyl ether used for maintenance of general anaesthesia. Volatile agents such as desflurane may activate GABA channels and hyperpolarize cell membranes. In addition, they may inhibit certain calcium channels and therefore prevent release of neurotransmitters and inhibit glutamate channels. Volatile anesthetics easily partition into cellular membranes and could expand the volume of the cell membrane and subsequently distort channels necessary for sodium ion flux and the development of action potentials necessary for synaptic transmission. Desflurane preconditions human myocardium against ischemia through activation of mitochondrial K(ATP) channels, adenosine A1 receptor, and alpha and beta adrenoceptors.

Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to bacterial 50S ribosomal subunits. It may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal depending on the organism and drug concentration.
1170	DB01191	Dexfenfluramine		Dexfenfluramine, also marketed under the name Redux, is a serotoninergic anorectic drug. For a fairly limited time during the middle of the nineties, the US FDA had approved it for use in managing weight loss. However, following multiple concerns about the cardiovascular side-effects of the drug, such approval was withdrawn.
1171	DB01192	Oxymorphone	Anxiety/Severe Pain/Moderate Pain/Perioperative analgesia/Obstetrical analgesia therapy	An opioid analgesic with actions and uses similar to those of morphine, apart from an absence of cough suppressant activity. It is used in the treatment of moderate to severe pain, including pain in obstetrics. It may also be used as an adjunct to anesthesia (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1092). On June 8, 2017, FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals to remove the medication from the market due to opioid misuse and abuse risks associated with the product's injectable reformulation.
1172	DB01193	Acebutolol	Chronic Stable Angina Pectoris/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Arrhythmia of ventricular origin	A cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with little effect on the bronchial receptors. The drug has stabilizing and quinidine-like effects on cardiac rhythm as well as weak inherent sympathomimetic action.
1173	DB01194	Brinzolamide	Ocular Hypertension	Brinzolamide is a highly specific, non-competitive, reversible carbonic anhydrase inhibitor. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an enzyme found in many tissues of the body including the eye. It catalyzes the reversible reaction involving the hydration of carbon dioxide and the dehydration of carbonic acid. In humans, carbonic anhydrase exists as a number of isoenzymes, the most active being carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II). Inhibition of carbonic anhydrase in the ciliary processes of the eye decreases aqueous humor secretion, presumably by slowing the formation of bicarbonate ions with subsequent reduction in sodium and fluid transport. The result is a reduction in intraocular pressure. Brinzolamide is indicated in the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.
1174	DB01195	Flecainide	Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation/Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)/Severe Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia/Severe Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/Severe Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia/Severe Supraventricular Tachycardias/Severe Sustained ventricular tachycardia/Severe ventricular arrhythmias	"Flecainide is a Class I anti-arrhythmic agent like encainide and propafenone. Flecainide’s development began in 1966 and was first synthesized in 1972 as an attempt to generate new anesthetics. It is used to prevent supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and flutter.[L8878,L5056]
Flecainide was granted FDA approval on 31 October 1985."

1195	DB01216	Finasteride	Androgenetic Alopecia/Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)/Hirsutism/Symptomatic Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia	"Finasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound[Label] and specific inhibitor of steroid Type II 5α-reductase, which is an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It works in a similar fashion as dutasteride, which is another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, by exerting antiandrogenic effects. Finasteride is an orally active drug that was first approved by the FDA in 1992 for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to improve symptoms and reduce the risk for acute urinary retention or the need for surgical procedures.[Label,L6244] In 1998, it was approved by the FDA to treat male pattern hair loss. Finasteride is commonly marketed under the brand names Propecia and Proscar to be used aloneo or in combination with doxazosin, an alpha-blocker.
Both benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia are androgen-dependent disorders that are characterized by in situ high levels of DHT. In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as tamsulosin and terazosin are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5α-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control."
1196	DB01217	Anastrozole	Advanced Breast Cancer/Locally Advanced Breast Cancer (LABC)/Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC)/Stage I Breast Carcinoma/Invasive, early Breast Cancer	"Anastrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI), similar to letrozole, used to decrease circulating estrogen levels in the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-responsive breast cancer. Anastrozole is also related to exemestane, a steroidal AI, but its non-steroidal nature provides stark advantages including a lack of steroid-associated adverse effects such as weight gain and acne. Aromatase inhibitors, including anastrozole, have become endocrine drugs of choice in the treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer due to a more favourable efficacy and adverse effect profile as compared to earlier estrogen receptor modulators such as tamoxifen.[A186877,A186955]
Anastrozole was first approved for use in the United States in 1995."

1204	DB01225	Enoxaparin	Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS)/Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)/ST Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI)	Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin. Enoxaparin is used to prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and is given as a subcutaneous injection. Enoxaparin binds to and accelerates the activity of antithrombin III. By activating antithrombin III, enoxaparin preferentially potentiates the inhibition of coagulation factors Xa and IIa. Factor Xa catalyzes the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, so enoxaparin's inhibition of this process results in decreased thrombin and ultimately the prevention of fibrin clot formation. Low molecular weight heparins are less effective at inactivating factor IIa due to their shorter length compared to unfractionated heparin.

1214	DB01235	Levodopa	Paralysis agitans/Parkinson's Disease (PD)/Parkinsonism/Postencephalitic parkinsonism/Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)/Advanced Motor fluctuations	Levodopa is a prodrug of dopamine that is administered to patients with Parkinson's due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier[Label]. Levodopa can be metabolised to dopamine on either side of the blood-brain barrier and so it is generally administered with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to prevent metabolism until after it has crossed the blood-brain barrier[Label,A177781]. Once past the blood-brain barrier, levodopa is metabolized to dopamine and supplements the low endogenous levels of dopamine to treat symptoms of Parkinson's[Label]. The first developed drug product that was approved by the FDA was a levodopa and carbidopa combined product called Sinemet that was approved on May 2, 1975[A177781,L6133].

Gemfibrozil was granted FDA approval on 21 December 1981.
1221	DB01242	Clomipramine	Depression/Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)/Panic Disorders	Clomipramine, the 3-chloro analog of imipramine, is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, clomipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, clomipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as clomipramine, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical β-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H1 receptors, α1-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Clomipramine may be used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and disorders with an obsessive-compulsive component (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s disorder). Unlabeled indications include panic disorder, chronic pain (e.g. central pain, idiopathic pain disorder, tension headache, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain), cataplexy and associated narcolepsy, autistic disorder, trichotillomania, onchophagia, stuttering, premature ejaculation, and premenstrual syndrome. Clomipramine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and demethylated in the liver to its primary active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine.

1234	DB01255	Lisdexamfetamine	Attention Deficit Disorder With Hyperactivity (ADHD)/Binge Eating Disorder (BED)	"Also known as Vyvanse, lisdexamfetamine (L-lysine-d-amphetamine) is a prodrug of the psychostimulant d-amphetamine . It is paired with the essential amino acid L-lysine. Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate increases attention span and decreases restlessness in children and adults who are overactive/hyperactive, cannot concentrate for long periods, or are easily distracted or impulsive .
As a central nervous system stimulant, lisdexamfetamine is utilized as an adjunct therapy in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). As a prodrug, lisdexamfetamine was specifically engineered as an abuse-resistant product .  The mechanism by which this occurs is through delayed release after ingestion (unlike some other psychostimulant drugs, which may be abused). After oral administration and absorption, enzyme hydrolysis after contact with red blood cells metabolize lisdexamfetamine into L- lysine, a naturally occurring essential amino acid and active d-amphetamine, which is responsible for the drug’s pharmacological effects. Gastrointestinal pH does not affect this conversion, and the addition of the L-lysine slows the amount of d-amphetamine available in the circulation and central nervous system ."
1235	DB01256	Retapamulin	Staphylococcal impetigo/Streptococcal impetigo	Retapamulin, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline as the ointment Altabax, is an antibiotic for skin infections like impetigo. It was approved by the FDA in April 2007.

It is a partially purified fraction of the water extract of green tea leaves from Camellia sinensis, and is a mixture of catechins and other green tea components. Catechins constitute 85 to 95% (by weight) of the total drug substance which includes more than 55% of Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), other catechin derivatives such as Epicatechin (EC), Epigallocatechin (EGC), Epicatechin gallate (ECg) and some additional minor catechin derivatives i.e. Gallocatechin gallate (GCg), Gallocatechin (GC), Catechin gallate (Cg), and Catechin (C). In addition to the known catechin components, it also contains gallic acid, caffeine, and theobromine which together constitute about 2.5% of the drug substance. The remaining amount of the drug substance contains undefined botanical constituents derived from green tea leaves.
1245	DB01267	Paliperidone	Delusional Parasitosis/Schizoaffective Disorders/Schizophrenic Disorders	Paliperidone is the primary active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action is unknown but it is likely to act via a similar pathway to risperidone. It has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism. Paliperidone is also active as an antagonist at alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone was approved by the FDA for treatment of schizophrenia on December 20, 2006.

1265	DB01289	Glisoxepide		Glisoxepide is one of the sulphonamide-derived oral antidiabetic drugs. It inhibits the uptake of bile acids into isolated rat hepatocytes. However it inhibits taurocholate uptake only in the absence of sodium ions. Glisoxepide uptake could be further inhibited by blockers of the hepatocellular monocarboxylate transporter, by the loop diuretic bumetanide, by 4,4'-diisothiocyano-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate (DIDS) and by sulphate.  These results are consistent with the transport of glisoxepide via the transport system for the unconjugated bile acid cholate. [A31819,A31820]
1266	DB01291	Pirbuterol		"Pirbuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilator. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that pirbuterol has a preferential effect on beta-2 Adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta-2 adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta-2 receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10-50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established.
The pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, including pirbuterol, are at least in proof attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (AlP) to cyclic-3† ,5†-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."

1268	DB01295	Bevantolol		Bevantolol is a beta-1 adrenoceptor antagonist that has been shown to be as effective as other beta blockers for the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. Mechanism of Action Animal experiments confirm both agonist and antagonist effects on alpha-receptors, in addition to antagonist activity at beta-1 receptors.
1269	DB01296	Glucosamine		Glucosamine is commonly used as a treatment for osteoarthritis, although its acceptance as a medical therapy varies. It is an amino sugar and precursor of glycosylated proteins and lipids. Since glucosamine is a precursor for glycosaminoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans are a major component of joint cartilage, supplemental glucosamine may help to rebuild cartilage and treat arthritis.
1270	DB01297	Practolol		A beta-adrenergic antagonist that has been used in the emergency treatment of cardiac arrhythmias.
1271	DB01298	Sulfacytine		"Sulfacytine is a short-acting sulfonamide. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections.
Sulfacytine is a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. It inhibits bacterial synthesis of of dihydrofolic acid by preventing the condensation of the pteridine with para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid."

1273	DB01301	Rolitetracycline		A pyrrolidinylmethyl tetracycline.
1274	DB01303	Oxtriphylline	Bronchoconstriction	Oxtriphylline is the choline salt form of theophylline. Once in the body, theophylline is released and acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, adenosine receptor blocker, and histone deacetylase activator. Its main physiological reponse is to dilate the bronchioles. As such, oxytriphylline is indicated mainly for asthma, bronchospasm, and COPD (i.e. all the same indications as the other theophyllines). It is marketed under the name Choledyl SA, and several forms of oxytriphylline have been discontinued. In the US, oxtriphylline is no longer available.
1275	DB01306	Insulin Aspart	Diabetes Mellitus (DM)/Diabetic Ketoacidosis/Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)/Type 1 Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus/Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus/Hyperglycemia during critical illness	"Insulin aspart is a rapid-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes. Insulin is typically prescribed for the management of diabetes mellitus to mimic the activity of endogenously produced human insulin, a peptide hormone produced by beta cells of the pancreas that promotes glucose metabolism. Insulin is released from the pancreas following a meal to promote the uptake of glucose from the blood into internal organs and tissues such as the liver, fat cells, and skeletal muscle. Absorption of glucose into cells allows for its transformation into glycogen or fat for storage. Insulin also inhibits hepatic glucose production, enhances protein synthesis, and inhibits lipolysis and proteolysis among many other functions.
Insulin is an important treatment in the management of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) which is caused by an autoimmune reaction that destroys the beta cells of the pancreas, resulting in the body not being able to produce or synthesize the insulin needed to manage circulating blood sugar levels. As a result, people with T1D rely primarily on exogenous forms of insulin, such as insulin aspart, to lower glucose levels in the blood. Insulin is also used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), another form of diabetes mellitus that is a slowly progressing metabolic disorder caused by a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors that promote chronically elevated blood sugar levels. Without treatment or improvement in non-pharmacological measures such as diet and exercise to lower blood glucose, high blood sugar eventually causes cellular resistance to endogenous insulin, and in the long term, damage to pancreatic islet cells. Insulin is typically prescribed later in the course of T2D, after trying several oral medications such as DB00331, DB01120, or DB01261 have been tried, when sufficient damage has been caused to pancreatic cells that the body is no longer able to produce insulin on its own. 
Marketed as the brand name product NovoRapid, insulin aspart begins to exert its effects within 15 minutes of subcutaneous administration, while peak levels occur 30 to 90 minutes after administration. Due to its duration of action of around 5 hours, NovoRapid is considered ""bolus insulin"" as it provides high levels of insulin in a short period of time to mimic the release of endogenous insulin from the pancreas after meals. Bolus insulin is often combined with once daily, long-acting ""basal insulin"" such as DB01307, DB09564, and DB00047 to provide low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.
Insulin aspart is a recombinant, biosynthetic, fast-acting insulin analogue. Compared to human insulin, it has a single amino acid substitution at position B28 where proline is replaced with aspartic acid. This substitution decreases its propensity to form hexamers and gives it a higher rate of absorption following subcutaneous administration compared to native insulin. Insulin aspart is produced in a genetically modified strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast)
Without an adequate supply of insulin to promote absorption of glucose from the bloodstream, blood sugar levels can climb to dangerously high levels and can result in symptoms such as fatigue, headache, blurred vision, and increased thirst. If left untreated, the body starts to break down fat, instead of glucose, for energy which results in a build-up of ketone acids in the blood and a syndrome called ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening medical emergency. In the long term, elevated blood sugar levels increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetic neuropathy."
1276	DB01307	Insulin Detemir	Type 1 Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus/Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	"Insulin detemir is a long-acting form of insulin used for the treatment of hyperglycemia caused by Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.

Marketed as the brand name product Levemir, insulin detemir has a duration of action of 16-24 hours allowing for once-daily dosing, typically at bedtime. Due to its duration of action, Levemir is considered ""basal insulin"" as it provides low concentrations of background insulin that can keep blood sugar stable between meals or overnight. Basal insulin is often combined with short-acting ""bolus insulin"" such as DB00046, DB01309, and DB01306 to provide higher doses of insulin required following meals. Use of basal and bolus insulin together is intended to mimic the pancreas' production of endogenous insulin, with a goal of avoiding any periods of hypoglycemia.
Insulin detemir is produced using recombinant DNA technology in yeast cells. This insulin analogue has a 14-C fatty acid, myristic acid, bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. The myristoyl side chain increases self-association and albumin binding. This along with slow systemic absorption from the injection site prolongs distribution of the hormone into tissues and results in a long duration of action.

Insulin glulisine is a biosynthetic, rapid-acting human insulin analogue produced in a non-pathogenic laboratory strain of Escherichia coli (K12). This recombinant hormone differs from native human insulin in that the amino acid arginine at position B3 is replaced by lysine and the lysine at position B29 is replaced by glutamic acid. These structural modifications decrease hexamer formation, stabilize insulin glulisine monomers and increase the rate of absorption and onset of action compared to human insulin.

The drug is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of beta-lactamases and is active against a wide range of both aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. It has few side effects and is reported to be safe and effective in aged patients and in patients with hematologic disorders.
1292	DB01333	Cefradine		A semi-synthetic cephalosporin antibiotic.
1293	DB01336	Metocurine		Dimethyltubocurarinium (INN) or metocurine (USAN), also known as dimethyltubocurarine, is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant. Patients on chronic anticonvulsant drugs are relatively resistant to metocurine.
1294	DB01337	Pancuronium	Adjunct to general anesthesia therapy/Facilitation of small bowel intubation therapy/Smooth muscle relaxation prior to radiological procedures	A bis-quaternary steroid that is a competitive nicotinic antagonist. As a neuromuscular blocking agent it is more potent than curare but has less effect on the circulatory system and on histamine release.
1295	DB01338	Pipecuronium		Pipecuronium is a piperazinyl androstane derivative which is a non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent.
1296	DB01339	Vecuronium	Adjunct to general anesthesia therapy/Facilitation of small bowel intubation therapy/Smooth muscle relaxation prior to radiological procedures	Monoquaternary homolog of pancuronium. A non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent with shorter duration of action than pancuronium. Its lack of significant cardiovascular effects and lack of dependence on good kidney function for elimination as well as its short duration of action and easy reversibility provide advantages over, or alternatives to, other established neuromuscular blocking agents.
1297	DB01340	Cilazapril	Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)/High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)/Mild Essential Hypertension/Moderate Essential Hypertension	Cilazapril is an ACE inhibtor class drug used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. It belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) class of drugs.  It is a prodrug that is hydrolyzed after absorption to its main metabolite cilazaprilat. It is branded as Inhibace in Canada and other countries, Vascace and Dynorm in a number of European countries, among many other names. None of these varieties are available in the United States.
1298	DB01341	Dihydroquinidine barbiturate		
1299	DB01342	Forasartan		Forasartan, a specific angiotensin II antagonist, is used alone or with other antihypertensive agents to treat hypertension. Forasartan competes with angiotensin II for binding at the AT1 receptor subtype. As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in a decreases in systemic vascular resistance.
1300	DB01344	Tolevamer	Hyperkalemia	Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is a medication used to treat abnormally high potassium levels. It may be taken orally or by rectum, as an enema, and functions as a potassium-binding resin in the intestines. It is also an effective topical microbicide and spermicide, inhibiting the genital transfection of, among others, HIV.
1301	DB01345	Potassium cation		"Potassium is the major cation (positive ion) inside animal cells, while sodium is the major cation outside animal cells. The concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells, known as the membrane potential. The balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion pumps in the cell membrane. The cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell generate an action potential—a ""spike"" of electrical discharge. The ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission, muscle contraction, and heart function. Potassium is also an essential mineral needed to regulate water balance, blood pressure and levels of acidity."
1302	DB01346	Quinidine barbiturate		The administration of quinidine derivatives helps to observe various skin and mucosal reactions. A papulopurpuric eruption in a  patient (without thrombopenia) can be developed who is taking quinidine phenylethyl barbiturate intermittently and at reintroduction.(PMID: 9739909)
1303	DB01347	Saprisartan		Saprisartan is an AT1 receptor antagonist. It is based on medications of losartan's prototypical chemical structure. The mode of (functional) AT1 receptor antagonism has been characterized as insurmountable/noncompetitive for saprisartan.  It is very likely that slow dissociation kinetics from the AT1 receptor underlie insurmountable antagonism .
1304	DB01348	Spirapril		Spirapril is an ACE inhibitor antihypertensive drug used to treat hypertension. Spirapril is converted to the active spiraprilat after administration. ACE inhibitors are used primarily in treatment of hypertension and congestive heart failure.
1305	DB01349	Tasosartan		Tasosartan is a long-acting angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker. Its long duration of action has been attributed to its active metabolite enoltasosartan. It is used to treat patients with essential hypertension.
1306	DB01351	Amobarbital		A barbiturate with hypnotic and sedative properties (but not antianxiety). Adverse effects are mainly a consequence of dose-related CNS depression and the risk of dependence with continued use is high. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p565)
1307	DB01352	Aprobarbital		Aprobarbital is a barbiturate derivative synthesized in the 1920s by Ernst Preiswerk. It was determined that the substance was capable of demonstrating sedative, hypnotic, and anticonvulsant effects. A primary treatment indicated for the use of aprobarbital was subsequently insomnia. Aprobarbital was never as widely used as more common barbiturate derivatives such as phenobarbital and is now rarely prescribed.
1308	DB01353	Butobarbital		Butobarbital is a sedative and a hypnotic drug.
1309	DB01354	Heptabarbital		Heptabarbital is an intermediate or short term barbiturate used mainly for sedation and hypnosis.
1310	DB01355	Hexobarbital		A barbiturate that is effective as a hypnotic and sedative.
1311	DB01356	Lithium cation	Bipolar Disorder (BD)/Depression/Depression, Bipolar/Acute Manic episode	Lithium was used during the 19th century to treat gout. Lithium salts such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium citrate, and lithium orotate are mood stabilizers. They are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, since unlike most other mood altering drugs, they counteract both mania and depression. Lithium can also be used to augment other antidepressant drugs. It is also sometimes prescribed as a preventive treatment for migraine disease and cluster headaches. The active principle in these salts is the lithium ion Li+, which having a smaller diameter, can easily displace K+ and Na+ and even Ca+2, in spite of its greater charge, occupying their sites in several critical neuronal enzymes and neurotransmitter receptors.
1312	DB01357	Mestranol	Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding/Dysmenorrhea/Endometriosis/Hypermenorrhea/Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome/Oral Contraceptives (OC)	The 3-methyl ether of ethinyl estradiol. It must be demethylated to be biologically active. It is used as the estrogen component of many combination ORAL contraceptives.
1313	DB01359	Penbutolol		Penbutolol is a drug in the beta-blocker class used to treat hypertension. Penbutolol binds both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, rendering it a non-selective beta-blocker. Penbutolol can act as a partial agonist at beta adrenergic receptors, since it is a sympathomimetric drug. Penbutolol also demonstrates high binding affinity to the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A with antagonistic effects. This binding characteristic of penbutolol is being investigated for its implications in Antidepressant Therapy. Penbutolol is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree atrioventricular conduction block, bronchial asthma, and those with known hypersensitivity.
1314	DB01362	Iohexol		Iohexol is an effective non-ionic, water-soluble contrast agent which is used in myelography, arthrography, nephroangiography, arteriography, and other radiographic procedures. Its low systemic toxicity is the combined result of low chemotoxicity and low osmolality.
1315	DB01363	Ephedra		Ephedra is an alkaloid chemical compound traditionally obtained from the plant Ephedra sinica. The sale of ephedra-containing supplements intended to increase muscle weight or promote weight loss was banned in the United States in 2004 due to the risk for adverse effects and a lack of evidence for clinical effectiveness. The drug is still sold in Canada in OTC formulations for respiratory conditions associated with bronchial asthma.
1316	DB01364	Ephedrine	Asthma Bronchial/Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV)/Idiopathic orthostatic hypotension	An alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonist that may also enhance release of norepinephrine. It has been used in the treatment of several disorders including asthma, heart failure, rhinitis, and urinary incontinence, and for its central nervous system stimulatory effects in the treatment of narcolepsy and depression. It has become less extensively used with the advent of more selective agonists.
1317	DB01365	Mephentermine		A sympathomimetic agent with mainly indirect effects on adrenergic receptors. It is used to maintain blood pressure in hypotensive states, for example, following spinal anesthesia. Although the central stimulant effects of mephentermine are much less than those of amphetamine, its use may lead to amphetamine-type dependence. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p1248)
1318	DB01366	Procaterol		A long-acting beta-2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It is a potent bronchodilator that may be administered orally or by aerosol inhalation. [PubChem]
1319	DB01367	Rasagiline	Parkinson's Disease (PD)	Rasagiline is an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and is used as a monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease or as an adjunct therapy in more advanced cases.
1320	DB01369	Quinupristin	Bacterial Infections/Infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci/Complicated Skin and subcutaneous tissue bacterial infection	Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a combination of two antibiotics used to treat infections by staphylococci and by vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Dalfopristin inhibits the early phase of protein synthesis in the bacterial ribosome and quinupristin inhibits the late phase of protein synthesis. The combination of the two components acts synergistically and is more effective in vitro than each component alone.
1321	DB01370	Aluminium		A metallic element that has the atomic number 13, atomic symbol Al, and atomic weight 26.98.
1322	DB01373	Calcium	Dietary and Nutritional Therapies	Calcium plays a vital role in the anatomy, physiology and biochemistry of organisms and of the cell, particularly in signal transduction pathways. The skeleton acts as a major mineral storage site for the element and releases Ca2+ ions into the bloodstream under controlled conditions. Circulating calcium is either in the free, ionized form or bound to blood proteins such as serum albumin. Although calcium flow to and from the bone is neutral, about 5 mmol is turned over a day. Bone serves as an important storage point for calcium, as it contains 99% of the total body calcium. Low calcium intake may also be a risk factor in the development of osteoporosis. The best-absorbed form of calcium from a pill is a calcium salt like carbonate or phosphate. Calcium gluconate and calcium lactate are absorbed well by pregnant women. Seniors absorb calcium lactate, gluconate and citrate better unless they take their calcium supplement with a full breakfast.
1323	DB01375	Aluminium monostearate		Aluminium monostearate is a salt of stearic acid and aluminium with the molecular formula Al(OH)2C18H35O2. Also known as dihydroxyaluminium or dihydroxy(stearato)aluminium, it is used to form gels in the packaging of pharmaceuticals and in the preparation of colors for cosmetics. While considered safe for use, extensive usage may result in aluminum accumulation.
1324	DB01377	Magnesium oxide	Acid indigestion/Heartburn/Bowel preparation therapy/Dietary and Nutritional Therapies	Magnesium oxide is an inorganic compound that occurs in nature as the mineral periclase. In aqueous media combines quickly with water to form magnesium hydroxide. It is used as an antacid and mild laxative and has many nonmedicinal uses.
1325	DB01378	Magnesium cation	Dietary and Nutritional Therapies	"Magnesium hydroxide is used primarily in ""Milk of Magnesia"", a white aqueous, mildly alkaline suspension of magnesium hydroxide formulated at about 8%w/v. Milk of magnesia is primarily used to alleviate constipation, but can also be used to relieve indigestion and heartburn. When taken internally by mouth as a laxative, the osmotic force of the magnesia suspension acts to draw fluids from the body and to retain those already within the lumen of the intestine, serving to distend the bowel, thus stimulating nerves within the colon wall, inducing peristalsis and resulting in evacuation of colonic contents."
1326	DB01380	Cortisone acetate	Acne Rosacea/Acute Gouty Arthritis/Adrenal cortical hypofunctions/Adrenocortical Hyperfunction/Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS)/Anterior Segment Inflammation/Aspiration Pneumonitis/Asthma Bronchial/Atopic Dermatitis (AD)/Berylliosis/Bullous dermatitis herpetiformis/Bursitis/Choroiditis/Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH)/Congenital Hypoplastic Anemia/Conjunctivitis, Seasonal Allergic/Corneal Inflammation/Cushing's Syndrome/Dermatitis, Contact/Drug hypersensitivity reaction/Epicondylitis/Erythroblastopenia/Hypercalcemia of Malignancy/Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP)/Inflammatory Reaction/Iridocyclitis/Iritis/Leukemia, Acute/Loeffler's syndrome/Malignant Lymphomas/Mycosis Fungoides (MF)/Ophthalmia, Sympathetic/Optic Neuritis/Pemphigus/Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (PAR)/Post-traumatic Osteoarthritis/Psoriatic Arthritis/Regional Enteritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis/Rheumatoid Arthritis, Juvenile/Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (SAR)/Secondary thrombocytopenia/Serum Sickness/Severe Seborrheic Dermatitis/Stevens Johnson Syndrome/Synovitis/Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)/Trichinosis/Tuberculosis Infection/Tuberculosis Meningitis/Ulcerative Colitis (UC)/Uveitis/Acquired immune hemolytic anemia/Acute nonspecific tenosynovitis/Acute rheumatic carditis/Diffuse posterior uveitis/Exfoliative erythroderma/Non-suppurative Thyroiditis/Severe Psoriasis/Symptomatic Sarcoidosis/Varicella-zoster virus acute retinal necrosis	Cortisone acetate is a steroid hormone that has both glucocoriticoid and mineral corticoid activities. Corticosteroids are used to provide relief for inflamed areas of the body. They lessen swelling, redness, itching, and allergic reactions. They are often used as part of the treatment for a number of different diseases, such as severe allergies or skin problems, asthma, or arthritis. Endogenous glucocorticoids and some synthetic corticoids have high affinity to the protein transcortin (also called CBG, corticosteroid-binding protein), whereas all of them bind albumin. Glucocorticoids also bind to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor.
1327	DB01381	Ginkgo biloba		The extract of the Ginkgo leaves contains flavonoid glycosides and terpenoids (ginkgolides, bilobalides) and has been used pharmaceutically for hundreds of years. It has many alleged nootropic properties, and is mainly used as memory and concentration enhancer, and anti-vertigo agent. Ginkgo extract seems to have three effects on the human body: it improves blood flow (including microcirculation in small capillaries) to most tissues and organs; it protects against oxidative cell damage from free radicals; and it blocks many of the effects of PAF (platelet aggregation, blood clotting) that have been related to the development of a number of cardiovascular, renal, respiratory and CNS (Central Nervous System) disorders.
1328	DB01382	Glymidine		Glycodiazine is used with diet to lower blood glucose by increasing the secretion of insulin from pancreas and increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. The mechanism of action of glycodiazine in lowering blood glucose appears to be dependent on stimulating the release of insulin from functioning pancreatic beta cells, and increasing sensitivity of peripheral tissues to insulin. Glycodiazine likely binds to ATP-sensitive potassium channel receptors on the pancreatic cell surface, reducing potassium conductance and causing depolarization of the membrane. Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin. It is used for the concomitant use with insulin for the treatment of noninsulin-dependent (type 2) diabetes mellitus.
1329	DB01384	Paramethasone		A glucocorticoid with the general properties of corticosteroids. It has been used by mouth in the treatment of all conditions in which corticosteroid therapy is indicated except adrenal-deficiency states for which its lack of sodium-retaining properties makes it less suitable than hydrocortisone with supplementary fludrocortisone. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p737)
1330	DB01388	Mibefradil		Mibefradil was withdrawn from the market in 1998 because of potentially harmful interactions with other drugs.
1331	DB01390	Sodium bicarbonate	Acid indigestion/Barbiturate intoxication/Heartburn/Hyperkalemia/Metabolic Acidosis/Pruritis of the skin/Skin Irritation/Upset stomach/Methyl alcohol poisoning/Prophylaxis of Contrast-induced nephropathy/Salicylate poisoning/Severe Diarrhea	Sodium bicarbonate is a white, crystalline powder that is commonly used as a pH buffering agent, an electrolyte replenisher, systemic alkalizer and in topical cleansing solutions.
1332	DB01392	Yohimbine		A plant alkaloid with alpha-2-adrenergic blocking activity. Yohimbine has been used as a mydriatic and in the treatment of impotence. It is also alleged to be an aphrodisiac.
1333	DB01393	Bezafibrate	Dyslipidemia (Fredrickson Type Ⅱa)/Fredrickson classification type IV Hyperlipidemia/Fredrickson classification type V Hyperlipidemia/Type IIb hyperlipoproteinaemia	Antilipemic agent that lowers cholesterol and triglycerides. It decreases low density lipoproteins and increases high density lipoproteins.
1334	DB01394	Colchicine	Behcet's Syndrome/Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF )/Gout Flares/Pericarditis/Postpericardiotomy Syndrome	"First approved by the FDA in 1961, colchicine is an alkaloid drug commonly used in the management of gout, a condition associated with the painful deposition of urate crystals in the joints.[A183614,L8138] It is derived from a plant belonging to the Lily family, known as Colchicum autumnale, or ""autumn crocus"". Other than its use in gout, colchicine has been approved for managing exacerbations of Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), a hereditary autoinflammatory condition.[A186320,L8141]"
1335	DB01395	Drospirenone	Acne Vulgaris/Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding/Dysmenorrhea/Endometriosis/Estrogen Deficiency/Hirsutism/Hypermenorrhea/Menstrual Irregularities/Osteoporotic Fractures/Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder/Vasomotor Symptoms/Vulvovaginal Atrophy/Folate supplementation therapy/Hormone Replacement Therapy/Oral Contraceptives (OC)	"Drospirenone is a synthetic progestin commonly found in the popular oral contraceptive, Yaz in combination with Ethinyl estradiol. Aside from its contraceptive effects, drospirenone is used with estrogens to control acne and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). 
Drospirenone has been the subject of widespread safety concern due to the possibility of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism associated with its use.[A182543,A182552] In 2012, however, a safety statement by the FDA concluded that the increase in the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the use of drospirenone remains unclear, as studies regarding this risk are conflicting. Some studies have demonstrated a significantly increased risk and some demonstrating no risk of thromboembolic events.  In its statement, the FDA has mentioned that increased risk of venous thromboembolism with oral contraceptives such as drospirenone exists but remains lower than the risk of this condition during pregnancy and during the postpartum period, and this should be considered when assessing potential risks of hormonal contraceptive use."
1336	DB01396	Digitoxin		A cardiac glycoside sometimes used in place of digoxin. It has a longer half-life than digoxin; toxic effects, which are similar to those of digoxin, are longer lasting. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p665)
1337	DB01397	Magnesium salicylate		Magnesium salicylate is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat mild to moderate pain. It is available in several over-the-counter (OTC) formulations. Though the recommended doseage is 1160 mg every six hours, per package directions of the Doan's OTC brand (580 mg magnesium salicylate tetrahydrate, equivalent to 934.4 mg anhydrous magnesium salicylate), effective pain relief is often found with a half dosage, with reduced anti-inflammatory results.
1338	DB01399	Salsalate		Salsalate is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. Salsalate's mode of action as an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agent may be due to inhibition of synthesis and release of prostaglandins. The usefulness of salicylic acid, the active in vivo product of salsalate, in the treatment of arthritic disorders has been established. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo. Salsalate is readily soluble in the small intestine where it is partially hydrolyzed to two molecules of salicylic acid. A significant portion of the parent compound is absorbed unchanged and undergoes rapid esterase hydrolysis in the body. The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours.
1339	DB01400	Neostigmine	Curarization therapy/Myasthenia Gravis/Neuromuscular Blockade/Ogilvie's syndrome/Postoperative Urinary Retention/Post-operative intestinal atony	A cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine.

Trisalicylate significantly reduces methotrexate renal clearance, displacing methotrexate from protein, increasing the fraction unbound by 28% [A19653, A19654].
1341	DB01403	Methotrimeprazine	Amnesia/Anxiety/Bipolar Affective Disorders/Nausea and vomiting/Pain, Cancer/Phantom Limb Pain (PLP)/Post-Herpetic Neuralgia (PHN)/Schizophrenic Disorders/Senile psychosis/Trigeminal Neuralgia (TN)/Neurocostal neuralgia/Perioperative analgesia	A phenothiazine with pharmacological activity similar to that of both chlorpromazine and promethazine. It has the histamine-antagonist properties of the antihistamines together with central nervous system effects resembling those of chlorpromazine. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p604)
1342	DB01404	Ginseng		Ginseng is promoted as an adaptogen (a product that increases the body's resistance to stress), one which can to a certain extent be supported with reference to its anticarcinogenic and antioxidant properties. Ginseng is also known to contain phytoestrogens.
1343	DB01405	Temafloxacin		Temafloxacin is an antibiotic agent belonging to the fluoroquinolone drug class. It was first approved for use in the U.S. market in 1992, but was withdrawn shortly due to the reports of serious adverse reactions, such as allergic reactions and hemolyric anemia, resulting in three deaths.

1350	DB01412	Theobromine		Theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine) is the principle alkaloid in Theobroma cacao (the cacao bean) and other plants. A xanthine alkaloid that is used as a bronchodilator and as a vasodilator. It has a weaker diuretic activity than theophylline and is also a less powerful stimulant of smooth muscle. It has practically no stimulant effect on the central nervous system. It was formerly used as a diuretic and in the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, pp1318-9)
1351	DB01413	Cefepime	Bacterial Infections/Complicated Intra-Abdominal Infections/Complicated Urinary Tract Infections/Meningitis, Bacterial/Neutropenia, Febrile/Pyelonephritis/Severe Pneumonia/Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections/Moderate Pneumonia/Uncomplicated skin and subcutaneous tissue bacterial infections	Cefepime is a fourth-generation cephalosporin antibiotic developed in 1994. Cefepime is active against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with greater activity against both than third-generation antibiotics. Cefepime is usually reserved to treat severe nosocomial pneumonia, infections caused by multi-resistant microorganisms (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and empirical treatment of febrile neutropenia.
1352	DB01414	Cefacetrile		A derivative of 7-aminocephalosporanic acid.
1353	DB01415	Ceftibuten	Acute Bacterial Exacerbation of Chronic Bronchitis (ABECB)/Bacterial Infections/Otitis media bacterial/Streptococcal Pharyngitis/Streptococcal tonsillitis	Ceftibuten is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic that is orally-administered. It is typically used to treat acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis (ABECB), acute bacterial otitis media, pharyngitis, and tonsilitis.

Coumarin derivatives inhibit the reduction of vitamin K by vitamin K reductase. This prevents carboxylation of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors, II, VII, IX and X, and interferes with coagulation. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, international normalized ratio and liver panel should be monitored. Patients on acenocoumarol are prohibited from giving blood.
1356	DB01419	Antrafenine		Antrafenine is a piperazine derivative drug that acts as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug with similar efficacy to naproxen. It is not widely used as it has largely been replaced by newer drugs.
1357	DB01420	Testosterone propionate		Testosterone propionate is a slower releasing anabolic steroid with a short half-life. This characteristic allows the user to run short testosterone propionate cycles of 8-10 weeks as optimal peak blood plasma levels are achieved at 2-4 weeks. It is a synthetic androstane steroid derivative of testosterone in the form of 17β propionate ester of testosterone. Testosterone propionate was developed initially by Watson labs, and FDA approved on February 5, 1974.

It is a hydroxyquinoline derivative unrelated to other classes of drugs. Nitroxoline is active against bacterial gyrases.
1360	DB01423	Stepronin		Strepronin is a mucolytic drug. A mucolytic agent is any agent which dissolves thick mucus usually used to help relieve respiratory difficulties. The viscosity of mucous secretions in the lungs is dependent upon the concentrations of mucoprotein as well as the presence of disulfide bonds between these macromolecules and DNA.
1361	DB01424	Aminophenazone		Aminophenazone is a pyrazolone with analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties that carries a risk of agranulocytosis. In biomedical applications, radiolabelled (13C-labeled) aminophenazone has been used in breath tests to measure the cytochrome P-450 metabolic activity in liver function tests.
1362	DB01425	Alizapride		Alizapride is a dopamine antagonist that is capable of demonstrating both prokinetic and antiemetic effects. This kind of pharmacological activity makes it effective for use in the treatment of various kinds of nausea and vomiting, including that which may occur postoperatively.
1363	DB01426	Ajmaline		An alkaloid found in the root of Rauwolfia serpentina, among other plant sources. It is a class Ia antiarrhythmic agent that apparently acts by changing the shape and threshold of cardiac action potentials. Ajmaline produces potent sodium channel blocking effects and a very short half-life which makes it a very useful drug for acute intravenous treatments. The drug has been very popular in some countries for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with the Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome and in well tolerated monomorphic ventricular tachycardias. It has also been used for many years as a drug to challenge the conduction system of the heart in cases of bundle branch block and syncope. In these cases, abnormal prolongation of the HV interval has been taken as a proof for infrahisian conduction defects tributary for permanent pacemaker implantation.

It is typically found in combination products Nodolor and Midrin containing isometheptene and acetaminophen used for the relief of tension and vascular headaches. It is a US Schedule IV drug and its clinical use is limited.
1430	DB01496	Barbituric acid derivative		
1431	DB01497	Etorphine		A narcotic analgesic morphinan used as a sedative in veterinary practice. In certain countries, etorphine is classified as a Schedule 1 drug and hence, in these countries, it can be used legally only by health professionals and for research purposes. Etorphine is only available to the patients under an official prescription. In the US, Etorphine is listed as a Schedule I drug, although Etorphine hydrochloride is classified as Schedule II.
1432	DB01498	Alphamethadol		
1433	DB01499	Alphameprodine		Alphameprodine is an opioid analgesic classified by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration under Schedule I of illegal substances. The stereoisomer betameprodine is similarly classified, however alphameprodine is more widely used (both are referred to as Meprodine). Alphameprodine is a structural analogue of meperidine. It exerts physiological effects characteristic of opioids, such as analgesia, euphoria and sedation, as well as itching, nausea, and respiratory depression.
1434	DB01500	Oxabolone		
1435	DB01501	Difenoxin	Acute exacerbations of functional diarrhea/Severe or persistent diarrhea	"Difenoxin is a 4-phenylpiperidine which is closely related to the opioid analgesic meperidine. Difenoxin alone is a USA Schedule I controlled drug, as it may be habit forming. However, it is listed as a Schedule IV controlled drug if combined with atropine, which is added to decrease deliberate misuse. Motofen(R) is a brand mixture which combines atropine sulfate and difenoxin hydrochloride. It is approved by the FDA to treat acute and chronic diarrhea. 
Difenoxin is an active metabolite of the anti-diarrheal drug, diphenoxylate, which is also used in combination with atropine in the brand mixture Lomotil(R). It works mostly in the periphery and activates opioid receptors in the intestine rather than the central nervous system (CNS). [3] Difenoxin is also closely related to loperamide, but unlike loperamide it is still capable of crossing the blood brain barrier to produce weak sedative and analgesic effects. However, the antidiarrheal potency of difenoxin is much greater than its CNS effects, which makes it an attractive alternative to other opioids."

1463	DB01534	Chlorhexadol		Chlorhexadol is a sedative and hypnotic which is regulated in the United States as a Schedule III controlled substance. It is a derivative of chloral hydrate.
1464	DB01535	Carfentanil		Carfentanil or carfentanyl (Wildnil) is an analogue of the popular synthetic opioid analgesic fentanyl, and is one of the most potent opioids known (also the most potent opioid used commercially). Carfentanil was first synthesized in 1974 by a team of chemists at Janssen Pharmaceutica which included Paul Janssen. It has a quantitative potency approximately 10,000 times that of morphine and 100 times that of fentanyl, with activity in humans starting at about 1 microgram. It is marketed under the trade name Wildnil as a general anaesthetic agent for large animals. Carfentanil is intended for large-animal use only as its extreme potency makes it inappropriate for use in humans. Currently sufentanil, approximately 10–20 times less potent (500 to 1000 times the efficacy of morphine per weight) than carfentanil, is the maximum strength fentanyl analog for use in humans.
1465	DB01536	Androstenedione		A delta-4 C19 steroid that is produced not only in the testis, but also in the ovary and the adrenal cortex. Depending on the tissue type, androstenedione can serve as a precursor to testosterone as well as estrone and estradiol.

1473	DB01544	Flunitrazepam		Flunitrazepam is a benzodiazepine with pharmacologic actions similar to those of diazepam that can cause anterograde amnesia. Some reports indicate that it is used as a date rape drug and suggest that it may precipitate violent behavior. The United States Government has banned the importation of this drug.
1474	DB01545	Ethyl loflazepate		
1475	DB01546	Etryptamine		"In the 1960's, alpha-ethyltryptamine (αET), a non hydrazine reversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, was developed in the United States by the Upjohn chemical company for use as an antidepressant. αET was an FDA approved antidepressant under the name Monase. However, in 1962, after the discovery of an unacceptable incidence of agranulocytosis, the development of Monase was halted and the drug was withdrawn from potential market use. 
In 1993, the US Drug Enforcement Administration added αET to Schedule I of its Schedules of Controlled Substances, after an increasing incidence of its use as a recreational drug in the 1980's. Currently, αET is an illegal substance; however, it's activity is still under scientific investigation. 
αET is a stimulant and hallucinogen, but it is less stimulating and hallucinogenic than alpha-methyltryptamine, a closely related compound. Instead, the effects of αET, a tryptamine derivative, more closely resemble the amphetamine derived drug 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA). Similarly to MDMA, αET has been shown to release serotonin pre-synaptically, as well as lesser amounts of norepinephrine and dopamine. Like MDMA, increases in locomotor activity and mood elevation can be seen post administration."
1476	DB01547	Drotebanol		
1477	DB01548	Diprenorphine		A narcotic antagonist similar in action to naloxone. It is used to remobilize animals after etorphine neuroleptanalgesia and is considered a specific antagonist to etorphine. [PubChem]
1478	DB01549	Rolicyclidine		Rolicyclidine (PCPy) is classified as a dissociative anesthetic agent. It also has hallucinogenic and sedative properties. Because of its pharmacodynamic similarity to the drug phencyclidine (PCP),  rolicyclidine was added to the Schedule I list of illegal drugs in the USA in the 1970s.
1479	DB01550	Fenproporex		"Fenproporex is an orally active stimulant drug, which was developed in the 1960s. It is used as an appetite suppressant and a treatment for obesity. It is listed as an illicit substance in many countries due to addiction issues and listed as a prohibited substance by the World Anti-Doping Agency. Structurally, fenproporex (N-2-cyanoethylamphetamine) falls within the phenylethamine and amphetamine chemical class of drugs. The N-2-cyanoethyl substituent was once believed to be resistant to cleavage, because fenproporex -- once recommended as an obesity treatment for patients with cardiovascular disease -- was originally claimed to lack stimulant properties. Contrary to the claim, research has demonstrated easy in vivo cleavage of the N-2-cyanothyl substituent to yield amphetamine as a metabolite. [5] However, in clinical practice, central nervous system stimulative effects are less notorious than with some other agents such as diethylpropion and mazindol. [7]
In the United States fenproporex was never approved by the FDA for clinical use due to a lack of efficacy and safety data, and is listed as a drug in Schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act. In 2006 and 2009, the FDA issued warnings that it had been detected in diet pills sold online, and imported from foreign manufacturers.
Despite being banned in the United States, fenproporex has been described as the second most commonly consumed appetite suppressant worldwide, [6] with fenproporex containing anorectics still being commonly prescribed in South America. Little is known about the specific hazards of amphetamine based diet pills, however case reports have noted side effects such as chest pain, palpitations, headaches, and insomnia.

It consists of levothyroxine sodium (thyroxine, T4) and liothyronine sodium (triiodothyronine, T3) in a 4 to 1 ratio by weight. Liotrix was developed when it was believed that serum levels of both T4 and T3 were maintained by direct thyroidal secretion. It is now known that the thyroid gland secretes approximately ten times more T4 than T3 and that 80% of serum T3 is derived from deiodination of T4 in peripheral tissues. Administration of levothyroxine alone is sufficient for maintaining serum T4 and T3 levels in most patients and combination hormone replacement therapy generally offers no therapeutic advantage. In fact, administration of T3 may result in supratherapeutic levels of T3.
1513	DB01584	Thyroglobulin		Thyroglobulin (also known as Tg) is an enzyme thyroid hormone used by the thyroid gland to produce the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3).

1607	DB01685	Topiroxostat		Topiroxostat is a selective xanthine oxidase inhibitor developed for treatment and management of hyperuricemia and gout. Xanthine oxidase, or xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), regulates purine metabolism, and inhibition of the enzyme results in efficacious reduction of serum urate levels. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are classified into two groups; purine analogs such as DB00437 and DB05262, and non-purine agents which includes topiroxostat. While DB00437 is considered a first-line therapy in treating hyperuricemic conditions, it is often associated with side effects and ineffective in reducing uric acid levels under recommended dosing regimens. Renal complications are major comorbidities that limit the DB00437 therapy as dose reductions are recommended. Topiroxostat and its metabolites are shown to be unaffected by renal complications, thus may be effective in patients with chronic kidney diseases . Approved for therapeutic use in Japan since 2013, topiroxostat is marketed under the name Topiloric and Uriadec and is orally administered twice daily.

Williams in 1919. For many animals, pantothenic acid is an essential nutrient as it is required to synthesize coenzyme-A (CoA), as well as to synthesize and metabolize proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Pantothenic acid is the amide between pantoic acid and β-alanine and commonly found as its alcohol analog, the provitamin panthenol, and as calcium pantothenate. Small quantities of pantothenic acid are found in nearly every food, with high amounts in whole-grain cereals, legumes, eggs, meat, royal jelly, avocado, and yogurt. Pantothenic acid is an ingredient in some hair and skin care products. Only the dextrorotatory (D) isomer of pantothenic acid possesses biological activity. while the levorotatory (L) form may antagonize the effects of the dextrorotatory isomer.

It is the first in a new class of agents known as histone deacetylase inhibitors.  A recent study suggested that vorinostat also possesses some activity against recurrent glioblastoma multiforme, resulting in a median overall survival of 5.7 months (compared to 4 - 4.4 months in earlier studies). Further brain tumor trials are planned using combinations of vorinostat with other drugs.

2558	DB02709	Resveratrol		Resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene) is a polyphenolic phytoalexin. It is a stilbenoid, a derivate of stilbene, and is produced in plants with the help of the enzyme stilbene synthase. It exists as cis-(Z) and trans-(E) isomers. The trans- form can undergo isomerisation to the cis- form when heated or exposed to ultraviolet irradiation. In a 2004 issue of Science, Dr. Sinclair of Harvard University said resveratrol is not an easy molecule to protect from oxidation. It has been claimed that it is readily degraded by exposure to light, heat, and oxygen. However, studies find that Trans-resveratrol undergoes negligible oxidation in normal atmosphere at room temperature.

Elevations of the acid in blood levels may be associated with problems of glutamine or glutathione metabolism . Pidolic acid, in general, is found in large quantities in brain tissue and other tissues in bound form, like skin .
There are currently little to no medicines available that are clinically approved or marketed for employing pidolic acid as an active ingredient for any particular formal indication. Although pidolic acid is included in some over-the-counter, non-prescription dietary supplements for the proposed purpose of facilitating cognitive or memory enhancement, most available research suggest exercising caution in their recommendation as much more research is necessary [A32981, A32982]."

Approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in March 2011, Oteracil is available in combination with DB09257 and DB09256 within the commercially available product ""Teysuno"". The main active ingredient in Teysuno is DB09256, a pro-drug of DB00544 (5-FU), which is a cytotoxic anti-metabolite drug that acts on rapidly dividing cancer cells. By mimicking a class of compounds called ""pyrimidines"" that are essential components of RNA and DNA, 5-FU is able to insert itself into strands of DNA and RNA, thereby halting the replication process necessary for continued cancer growth.
Oteracil's main role within Teysuno is to reduce the activity of 5-FU within normal gastrointestinal mucosa, and therefore reduce's gastrointestinal toxicity . It functions by blocking the enzyme orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT), which is involved in the production of 5-FU."

3070	DB03255	Phenol	Irritation lips/Throat Pain/Throat irritation	Phenol is an antiseptic and disinfectant. It is active against a wide range of micro-organisms including some fungi and viruses, but is only slowly effective against spores. Phenol has been used to disinfect skin and to relieve itching. Phenol is also used as an oral analgesic or anesthetic in products such as Chloraseptic to treat pharyngitis. Additionally, phenol and its related compounds are used in surgical ingrown toenail treatment, a process termed phenolization. Research indicates that parental exposure to phenol and its related compounds are positively associated with spontaneous abortion. During the second world war, phenol injections were used as a means of execution by the Nazis. Phenol is a toxic compound whose vapours are corrosive to the skin, eyes, and respiratory tract.

It is an antiseptic and disinfectant agent with a broad bactericidal and fungicidal activity. It is most commonly available as a dichloride salt but is available as other various salts as well. It is used in wound dressings and mouth infections and may also have antifungal action, but may associate with skin ulceration. Dequalinium chloride is used as an active ingredient in tablets as Fluomizin for vaginal bacterial infections and in topical bacteriostat formulation as Dequadin. It has been studied for use in treatment of malaria and acute promyelocytic leukemia. Its multiple mode of action is thought to reduce the risk of resistance of pathogens.

4546	DB04829	Lysergic acid diethylamide		Debate continues over the nature and causes of chronic flashbacks. Explanations in terms of LSD physically remaining in the body for months or years after consumption have been discounted by experimental evidence. Some say HPPD is a manifestation of post-traumatic stress disorder, not related to the direct action of LSD on brain chemistry, and varies according to the susceptibility of the individual to the disorder. Many emotionally intense experiences can lead to flashbacks when a person is reminded acutely of the original experience. However, not all published case reports of chronic flashbacks appear to describe an anxious hyper-vigilant state reminiscent of post-traumatic stress disorder.
4547	DB04830	Buformin		Buformin is an anti-diabetic drug of the biguanide class, chemically related to metformin and phenformin. It was withdrawn from the market in most countries due to a high risk of causing lactic acidosis.

4549	DB04832	Zimelidine		Zimelidine has been banned worldwide due to serious, sometimes fatal, cases of central and/or peripheral neuropathy known as Guillain-Barré syndrome and due to a peculiar hypersensitivity reaction involving many organs including skin exanthema, flu-like symptoms, arthralgias, and sometimes eosinophilia. Additionally, zimelidine was charged to cause an increase in suicidal ideation and/or attempts among depressive patients.
4550	DB04833	Methaqualone		"Methaqualone is a sedative-hypnotic drug that is similar in effect to barbiturates, a general central nervous system depressant. The sedative-hypnotic activity was first noted by Indian researchers in the 1950s and in 1962 methaqualone itself was patented in the US by Wallace and Tiernan. Its use peaked in the early 1970s as a hypnotic, sedative, and muscle relaxant commonly used for insomnia. It has also been used illegally as a recreational drug, commonly known as Quaaludes, Sopors, Ludes or Mandrax (particularly in the 1970s in North America) depending on the manufacturer. Since at least 2001, it has been widely used in South Africa, where it is commonly referred to as ""smarties"" or ""geluk-tablette"" (meaning happy tablets). Clandestinely produced methaqualone is still seized by government agencies and police forces around the world."
4551	DB04834	Rapacuronium		Rapacuronium was withdrawn in 2001 in many countries due to risk of fatal bronchospasm.
4552	DB04835	Maraviroc	Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) Infection	Maraviroc (brand-named Selzentry, or Celsentri outside the U.S.) is a chemokine receptor antagonist drug developed by the drug company Pfizer that is designed to act against HIV by interfering with the interaction between HIV and CCR5.

4571	DB04854	Febuxostat	Chronic, symptomatic Hyperuricemia	Febuxostat is a xanathine oxidase (XO) inhibitor indicated in patients with gout suffering from hyperuricemia and is used in its chronic management. Febuxostat is not recommended for the treatment of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Febuxostat is marketed under the trade name Uloric by Takeda Pharmaceuticals America, Inc., and was approved by the FDA in February 2009.
4572	DB04855	Dronedarone	Nonvalvular Atrial Fibrillation	"Dronedarone is a Class III antiarrhythmic drug that works to restore the normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is a common sustained arrhythmia where the treatment primarily focuses on stroke prevention and symptom management. It is managed by rate control, rhythm control, prevention of thromboembolic events, and treatment of the underlying disease. Similar to amiodarone, dronedarone is a multichannel blocker that works to control rhythm and rate in atrial fibrillation. It meets criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes by blocking sodium, potassium, and calcium ion channels and inhibiting β-adrenergic receptors.[A34604,L9007] 
Dronedarone is a related benzofuran compound to amiodarone but its chemical structure lacks iodine moieties which are associated with amiodarone-induced thyroid problems.[A34604,T28] Additionally, the methyl sulfonyl group in its structure renders dronedarone to be more lipophilic with a shorter half-life than amiodarone. This ultimately leads to reduced tissue accumulation of the drug and decreased risk for organ toxicities, such as thyroid and pulmonary toxicities. Commonly marketed as Multaq®, dronedarone was approved by the FDA in July 2009 and Health Canada in August 2009. A safety concern for the risk of drug-induced hepatocellular injury has been issued following marketing of dronedarone."
4573	DB04856	Dexloxiglumide		Dexloxiglumide is a selective cholecystokinin type A (CCKA) receptor antagonist in phase III testing by Rottapharm in Europe only, as U.S. trials have been discontinued.

4574	DB04857	Brasofensine		Brasofensine is an orally administered dopamine reuptake inhibitor being developed for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease. Phase I/II trials for brasofensine have been completed in the U.K. In November 2001, NeuroSearch confirmed that the drug's development was discontinued in favor of NS 2230.
4575	DB04858	Tirapazamine		"Tirapazamine, also known as SR-4233, is an experimental anticancer drug that is activated in hypoxic conditions. This activation is very useful as this hypoxic state is found in human solid tumors in a common phenomenon known as tumor hypoxia. Hence, tirapazamine is solely activated in those hypoxic areas of solid tumors. It is important to take into consideration that normally, the cells in these hypoxic regions are resistant to radiotherapy and most anticancer drugs. For all these reasons, the combination of tirapazamine with other anticancer treatments is highly recommended. 
Tirapazamine entered phase III testing in 2006 for patients with head and neck cancer and gynecological cancer, as well as for other solid tumor cancer types."
4576	DB04859	Zanapezil		Zanapezil (TAK-147) is a selective acetylcholine (ACh) esterase inhibitor under investigation as a drug for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment.

4584	DB04867	Lintitript		Lintitript is a new, highly specific and potent CCK-A receptor antagonist.
4585	DB04868	Nilotinib	Chronic Phase Chronic Myeloid Leukemia/Refractory Gastrointestinal stromal tumor/Refractory, accelerated phase Chronic myeloid leukemia	Nilotinib, also known as AMN107, is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor under investigation as a possible treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). A Phase I clinical trial in 2006 showed that this drug was relatively safe and offered significant therapeutic benefits in cases of CML which were found to be resistant to treatment with imatinib (Gleevec), another tyrosine kinase inhibitor used as a first-line treatment for CML.
4586	DB04869	Olcegepant		Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals’ olcegepant (BIBN 4096) is a selective Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP) antagonist, a new class of drugs in development for the treatment of acute migraine attacks. Olcegepant is undergoing phase II trials in Europe and the US, with preliminary results suggesting that CGRP antagonists may represent a potential new approach to the treatment of migraine.
4587	DB04870	Oleoyl-estrone		Oleoyl-estrone (OE) is a fatty acid ester of estrone. This hormone occurs naturally and is found circulating in various animal species and humans. It has been shown in animal studies to promote the loss of body fat while maintaining body protein storage, maintaining nitrogen balance.  Body protein loss is an unpleasant effect of fat loss by the restriction of calories, and studies show that this drug appears to avoid this effect.
4588	DB04871	Lorcaserin	BMI >30 kg/m2	Lorcaserin (previously APD-356), a highly selective 5HT2C receptor agonist, is used for the treatment of obesity. It has been shown to reduce body weight and food intake in animal models of obesity, and it is thought that targeting the 5HT2C receptor may alter body weight by regulating satiety. Lorcaserin is marketed as a salt form called Belviq, which is lorcaserin hydrochloride.
4589	DB04872	Osanetant		Developed by Sanofi-Aventis (formerly Sanofi-Synthelabo), osanetant (SR-142801) is an NK3 receptor antagonist which was under development for the treatment of schizophrenia and other Central Nervous System (CNS) disorders. In a review of its R&amp;D portfolio, the company announced in August 2005 that it would cease any further development of osanetant. This follows an earlier decision to discontinue development of eplivanserin for schizophrenia.

4593	DB04876	Vildagliptin	Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus	Vildagliptin, previously identified as LAF237, is a new oral anti-hyperglycemic agent (anti-diabetic drug) of the new dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor class of drugs. Vidagliptin subsequently acts by inhibiting the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) by DPP-4. This inhibitory activity ultimately results in a two-fold  action where GLP-1 and GIP are present to potentiate the secretion of insulin by beta cells and suppress glucagon secretion by alpha cells in the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas. It is currently in clinical trials in the U.S. and has been shown to reduce hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus. While the drug is still not approved for use in the US, it was approved in Feb 2008 by European Medicines Agency for use within the EU and is listed on the Australian PBS with certain restrictions.
4594	DB04877	Voacamine		Voacamine is an alkaloid isolated from the bark of the Pescheria fuchsiae folia tree. It is an antimalarial drug approved for use in several African countries. Voacamine is also under investigation for use in modulating multidrug-resistance in tumor cells.

Furthermore, in 2009 the US FDA approved milnacipran for the additional indication of treating fibromyalgia , although other regional regulatory authorities like the EMA, among others, have not yet approved the agent for such treatment, citing lack of robust evidence of efficacy, insufficient demonstration of maintenance of effect, and other concerns [F3928, F3934]. Nevertheless, milnacipran demonstrates a somewhat unique characteristic among SNRIs to elicit a relatively balanced reuptake inhibition of both serotonin and noradrenaline, with a somewhat increased preference for noradrenaline reuptake inhibition - which is potentially a point of interest given the plausible proposal that noradrenaline plays an important role in the mitigation of pain signals in the descending inhibitory pain pathways in the brain and spinal cord [A175759, A175843, A175846].
Moreover, recent research has shown that the levorotatory enantiomer of milnacipran, levomilnacipran, may have the capacity to inhibit the activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1), which has investigationally been associated with β-amyloid plaque formation - making the agent a possible course of treatment for Alzheimer's disease ."

4699	DB04998	AGRO100		"AGRO100 is an oligonucleotide that functions as an aptamer and binds to nucleolin, a protein found intranuclear in all cells, but uniquely expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Such binding leads to internalization of the complex, and a strong anti-proliferative response in the tumor cell.
Pre-clinical testing demonstrates that the AGRO100 inhibition of nucleolin function produces anti-cancer effects against multiple types of the disease, including lung, prostate, breast, cervical, and colon cancer, as well as malignant melanoma and leukemia."
4700	DB04999	MBO7133		MB07133 is a HepDirect prodrug of an activated form of cytarabine (araC), an anti-cancer drug that is used to treat leukemia but is ineffective against primary liver cancer. AraC's anti-cancer activity is associated with its ability to be converted to its biologically active form, araCTP. However, araC is only slowly converted to araCTP in the liver or in primary liver tumors due to low levels of an enzyme in the liver that is required for the conversion of araC to araCMP, the first step in the activation pathway of the drug. Higher doses of araC cannot be used to overcome this limitation due to bone marrow toxicity resulting from rapid activation in that tissue. MB07133 uses our HepDirect technology to target a prodrug form of araCMP specifically to the liver. Once in the liver cell, the prodrug is rapidly cleaved, producing araCMP, bypassing the rate-limiting enzyme. Once generated in the target tissue, araCMP is rapidly converted to araCTP, the cancer-killing active form.

4715	DB05018	Migalastat	Fabry's Disease	"Fabry disease is a rare, progressive genetic disorder characterized by a defective GLA gene that causes a deficiency in the enzyme alpha-Galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4263]. This enzyme is responsible for breaking down glycosphingolipid substrate that, when deficient in patients with Fabry disease, builds up in the blood vessels, the kidneys, the nerves, the heart, and other organs [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278]. In the U.S., it is estimated that more than 3,000 people are living with Fabry disease, and an estimated more than 50 percent of these diagnosed patients are currently untreated .
Migalastat (approved and sold under Amicus Therapeutics' brand name Galafold) is subsequently an oral pharmacological chaperone of alpha-Gal A for the treatment of Fabry disease in adults who have amenable GLA variants [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278]. In these patients, migalastat works by stabilizing the body’s own dysfunctional alpha-Gal A enzyme so that it can clear the accumulation of glycosphingolipid disease substrate [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278]. Globally, it is estimated that approximately 35 to 50 percent of Fabry patients may have amenable GLA variants that are treatable with migalastat .
Given the rarity of Fabry disease and the proportion of Fabry disease patients that could benefit from migalastat therapy, Amicus Therapeutics' brand name Galafold was approved using the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious conditions where there is an unmet medical need and where a drug is shown to have certain effects that are reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit to patients [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278]. A further study is required to verify and describe the clinical benefits of Galafold, and the sponsor will be conducting a confirmatory clinical trial of Galafold in adults with Fabry disease [FDA Label, F1107, L4274, L4278].
Additionally, Galafold was alzo granted Priority Review designation, under which the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months of application filing where the agency determines that the drug, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in treating, diagnosing or preventing a serious condition over available therapies [FDA Label, F1107]. Galafold also received Orphan Drug designation, which provides incentives to assist and encourage the development of drugs for rare diseases [FDA Label, F1107].
As of August 2018, migalastat under Amicus Therapeutics' brand name Galafold is currently approved in Australia, Canada, European Union, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United States."

4751	DB05061	GFT14		"GFT14 is a new class of medicaction for treatment of cardiometabolic disease. GFT14 aims to target mixed dyslipidemia of type IIb (high levels of triglycerides and LDL-C) as one of the major indications of cardiometabolic disease.
GFT14 is destined to improve the condition of patients at risk from cardiovascular disease by a simultaneous and favorable action on the plasmatic lipids (rise of HDL- cholesterol et lowering of triglycerides) and on other risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes. Orally absorbed GFT14 has absolutely no structural link with current treatments for dyslipidemia (statin or fibrate based). The risks of medical interaction are weak and GFT14 may be easily combined with statins or other antidiabetic molecules (glitazones)."
4752	DB05063	Mitoquinone		Mitoquinone is based on a novel technology, targeted lipophilic cations, that transport and concentrate antioxidants into the mitochondria -- organelles inside cells that provide energy for life processes -- where they accumulate up to a thousand fold. In 2004, a genomic study of hereditary early-onset Parkinson's disease demonstrated a direct molecular link between mitochondrial dysfunction and the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. Mitochondrial dysfunction also has been shown to represent an early critical event in the pathogenesis of the sporadic form of Parkinson's disease. Clinical studies by the Parkinson's Study Group show that very high doses of an antioxidant called Coenzyme Q (which Mitoquinone effectively targets into mitochondria) appear to slow the progression of Parkinson's disease symptoms.

4780	DB05098	Leptin		Although leptin is a circulating signal that reduces appetite, in general, obese people have an unusually high circulating concentration of leptin. These people are said to be resistant to the effects of leptin, in much the same way that people with type 2 diabetes are resistant to the effects of insulin. Thus, obesity develops when people take in more energy than they use over a prolonged period of time, and this excess food intake is not driven by hunger signals, occurring in spite of the anti-appetite signals from circulating leptin. The high sustained concentrations of leptin from the enlarged fat stores result in the cells that respond to leptin becoming desensitized.

4956	DB05311	Ecallantide	Acute attack of hereditary angioedema	"Ecallantide is a potent and selective human plasma kallikrein inhibitor that is indicated for the symptomatic treatment of hereditary angioedema. Ecallantide is a recombinant 60-amino-acid protein produced in Pichia pastoris yeast cells that contains three intramolecular disulfide bonds [FDA Label]. It was discovered by phage display technology . It shares sequence similarities with the naturally occurring human protein tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which is also known lipoprotein-associated coagulation inhibitor (LACI) . The amino acid sequence of two compounds differ by seven amino acids . 
Ecallantide works by blocking kallikrein to participate in the kallikrein-kinin system, which is a complex proteolytic cascade that initiates inflammatory and coagulation pathways [FDA Label]. The protease plasma kallikerin facilitates the conversion of kininogen to bradykinin, which is a pro-inflammatory vasodilator that  increases vascular permeability and induces pain . Hereditary angioedema is a rare autosomal dominant disorder with mutations to C1-esterase-inhibitor (C1-INH) located on Chromosome 11q, resulting in substantially lower levels of C4 and C1-INH activity [FDA Label]. The disorder is associated with recurrent attacks of severe swelling and is thought to be caused by unregulated activity of kallikrein and excessive bradykinin production [FDA Label]. By reversibly binding to plasma kallikrein, ecallantide displays a rapid on-rate and a slow off-rate that results in high affinity inhibition in the picomolar range . Ecallantide is marketed by FDA and EMA under the trade name Kalbitor for subcutaneous injection. Apart from its FDA and EMA indication, ecallantide has been used off label in the management of nonhistaminergic angioedema, not due to HAE ."

4982	DB05351	Dexlansoprazole	Erosive Esophagitis(EE)/Heartburn/Healed erosive esophagitis/Symptomatic non-erosive gastroesphageal reflux disease	"Dexlansoprazole is a new generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and erosive esophagitis. Dexlansoprazole is the R-enantiomer of DB00448, which is composed of a racemic mixture of the R- and S-enantiomers. Compared to the older generation of PPIs (which includes DB00213, DB00338, and DB00448) , dexlansoprazole MR has a unique pharmacokinetic profile due to its delayed-release and dual-delivery release system. The active ingredient is released in two phases at different pH values and at different time points, resulting in two peak concentrations in the blood; 25% of the dose is released at pH 5.5 in the proximal duodenum, while the remaining 75% is released at pH 6.75 in the distal small intestine . As a result, dexlansoprazole has a peak concentration within 1-2 hours after dosing and another within 4-5 hours [FDA Label]. Dexlansoprazole's unique pharmacokinetics addresses limitations of the older generation PPIs including short plasma half-life, break-through symptoms, and need for meal-associated dosing . These characteristics make dexlansoprazole a good option for people who struggle with adherence and strict dosage timing before meals[A178087, A19566]. 
Dexlansoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects in the same way as other drugs in the PPI family by inhibiting the final step in gastric acid production. Dexlansoprazole targets the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme, which is involved in the secretion of hydrochloric acid through the exchange of H+ ions from the cytoplasm for K+ ions. Normally functioning (H+, K+)-ATPase stimulates hydrochloric acid secretion into the gastric lumen thereby increasing stomach acidity and lowering pH. Once absorbed into circulation, dexlansoprazole covalently binds to the sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells, which leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion. Despite dexlansoprazole's unique pharmacokinetic profile, efficacy in management of GERD symptoms is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including DB00338, DB00736, DB00448, DB00213, and DB01129.
Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal C. difficile), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life . PPIs such as dexlansoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes [A177577, A177580]. 
Dexlansoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as dexlansoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion ."
