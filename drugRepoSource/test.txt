31726039	Effect of seasonal variation in ambient temperature on RNA quality of breast cancer tissue in a remote biobank setting.	Studies involving oncology especially diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic monitoring are increasingly relying on molecular analyses. These analyses require high quality biomolecules to get accurate and precise results and this requires among others, monitoring for pre-analytical variables. The purpose of our study was to validate the SOPs of the newly established Egyptian National Cancer Institute (ENCI) biobank. We used a panel of 91 fresh frozen breast cancer tissue samples and their matched normal tissues and have investigated the overall quality (integrity and yield) of RNA extracted from fresh frozen breast tumor tissues and matched normal breast tissues. We investigated the effect of several factors including seasonal temperature variation, cold ischemia time, transportation method, and RNA extraction method. The RNA yield and quality were significantly increased with tumor samples collected in winter, transported on wet ice and using an automated RNA extraction platform. No significant effect was observed due to increased cold ischemia time >30 min. The effect of delay in time to cryopreservation on RNA degradation in fresh tissue samples may vary according to the type of tissue, temperature during tissue collection and transportation, and the use of stabilizing agents as RNA later.	2019
31665482	Unraveling triple-negative breast cancer tumor microenvironment heterogeneity: towards an optimized treatment approach.	Recent efforts of gene expression profiling analyses recognized at least 4 different triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) molecular subtypes. However, little is known regarding their tumor microenvironment (TME) heterogeneity.	Here, we investigated TME heterogeneity within each TNBC molecular subtype including immune infiltrate localization and composition together with expression of targetable immune pathways using publicly available transcriptomic and genomic datasets from a large TNBC series totaling 1512 samples. Associations between molecular subtypes and specific features was assessed using logistic regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.	We demonstrated that each TNBC molecular subtype exhibits distinct TME profiles associated with specific immune, vascularization, stroma and metabolism biological processes together with specific immune composition and localization. The immunomodulatory subtype was associated with the highest expression of adaptive immune-related gene signatures and a fully inflamed spatial pattern appearing to be the optimal candidate for immune check-point inhibitors. In contrast, most mesenchymal stem-like and luminal androgen receptor (LAR) tumors showed an immunosuppressive phenotype as witnessed by high expression levels of stromal signatures. Basal-like, LAR and Mesenchymal subtypes exhibited an immune cold phenotype associated with stromal and metabolism TME signatures and enriched in margin restricted spatial pattern. Tumors with high chromosomal instability and copy number loss in chromosome 5q and 15q regions including genomic loss of MHC-related genes showed reduced cytotoxic activity, as a plausible immune escape mechanism.	Our results demonstrate that each TNBC subtype is associated with specific TME profiles, setting the ground for a rationale tailoring of immunotherapy in TNBC patients.	2019

31623682	Dissociation of solid tumor tissues with cold active protease for single-cell RNA-seq minimizes conserved collagenase-associated stress responses.	Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is a powerful tool for studying complex biological systems, such as tumor heterogeneity and tissue microenvironments. However, the sources of technical and biological variation in primary solid tumor tissues and patient-derived mouse xenografts for scRNA-seq are not well understood.	We use low temperature (6 °C) protease and collagenase (37 °C) to identify the transcriptional signatures associated with tissue dissociation across a diverse scRNA-seq dataset comprising 155,165 cells from patient cancer tissues, patient-derived breast cancer xenografts, and cancer cell lines. We observe substantial variation in standard quality control metrics of cell viability across conditions and tissues. From the contrast between tissue protease dissociation at 37 °C or 6 °C, we observe that collagenase digestion results in a stress response. We derive a core gene set of 512 heat shock and stress response genes, including FOS and JUN, induced by collagenase (37 °C), which are minimized by dissociation with a cold active protease (6 °C). While induction of these genes was highly conserved across all cell types, cell type-specific responses to collagenase digestion were observed in patient tissues.	The method and conditions of tumor dissociation influence cell yield and transcriptome state and are both tissue- and cell-type dependent. Interpretation of stress pathway expression differences in cancer single-cell studies, including components of surface immune recognition such as MHC class I, may be especially confounded. We define a core set of 512 genes that can assist with the identification of such effects in dissociated scRNA-seq experiments.	2019
31615871	Bone Tropism in Cancer Metastases.	Bone is a frequent site of metastases in many cancers. Both bone properties and the tumor-intrinsic traits are associated with the metastatic propensity to bone (i.e., the bone tropism). Whereas an increasing body of mechanistic studies expanded our understanding on bone tropism, they also revealed complexity across the bone lesions originated from different cancer types. In this review, we will discuss the physical, chemical, and biological properties of bone microenvironment, identify potential players in every stage of bone metastases, and introduce some of the known mechanisms regulating the bone colonization. Our objectives are to integrate the knowledge established in different biological contexts and highlight the determinants of bone tropism.	2019
31570378	PTEN in Hereditary and Sporadic Cancer.	Germline pathogenic phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) mutations cause PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS), characterized by various benign and malignant tumors of the thyroid, breast, endometrium, and other organs. Patients with PHTS may present with other clinical features such as macrocephaly, intestinal polyposis, cognitive changes, and pathognomonic skin changes. Clinically, deregulation of PTEN function is implicated in other human diseases in addition to many types of human cancer. PTEN is an important phosphatase that counteracts one of the most critical cancer pathways: the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways. Although PTEN can dephosphorylate lipids and proteins, it also has functions independent of phosphatase activity in normal and pathological states. It is positively and negatively regulated at the transcriptional level as well as posttranslationally by phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, oxidation, and acetylation. Although most of its tumor-suppressor activity is likely to be caused by lipid dephosphorylation at the plasma membrane, PTEN also resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus, and its subcellular distribution is under strict control. In this review, we highlight our current knowledge of PTEN function and recent discoveries in understanding PTEN function regulation and how this can be exploited therapeutically for cancer treatment.	2019
31548224	Brain Metastasis Organotropism.	Brain metastases are associated with poor prognosis irrespective of the primary tumor they originate from. Current treatments for brain metastases are palliative, and patients with symptomatic brain metastasis have a one-year survival of <20%. Lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma have higher incidences of brain metastases compared with other types of cancers. However, it is not very clear why some cancers metastasize to the brain more frequently than others. Studies thus far suggest that brain-specific tropism of certain types of cancers is defined by a winning combination of the following factors: unique genetic subtypes of primary tumors or its subclones enabling detachment, dissemination, blood-brain barrier penetration, plus proliferation and survival in hypoxic low-glucose microenvironment; specific transcriptomic and epigenetic changes of colony-forming metastatic cells, allowing their outgrowth; favorable metastasis-permissive microenvironment of the brain created by interactions of cancer cells and cells in the brain through triggering inflammation, recruiting myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and promoting metabolic adaptation; immunosuppression resulting in the failure of adaptive immune response to recognize or kill cancer cells in the brain. Here, we briefly review recent advances in understanding brain metastasis organotropism and outline directions for future research.	2019
31501262	The Immune Microenvironment and Cancer Metastasis.	The dynamic interplay between neoplastic cells and the immune microenvironment regulates every step of the metastatic process. Immune cells contribute to invasion by secreting a cornucopia of inflammatory factors that promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and remodeling of the stroma. Cancer cells then intravasate to the circulatory system assisted by macrophages and use several pathways to avoid recognition by cytotoxtic lymphocytes and phagocytes. Circulating tumor cells that manage to adhere to the vasculature and encounter premetastic niches are able to use the associated myeloid cells to extravasate into ectopic organs and establish a dormant microscopic colony. If successful at avoiding repetitive immune attack, dormant cells can subsequently grow into overt, clinically detectable metastatic lesions, which ultimately account to most cancer-related deaths. Understanding how disseminated tumor cells evade and corrupt the immune system during the final stages of metastasis will be pivotal in developing new therapeutic modalities that combat metastasis.	2019
31483573	Evaluation of fixed-jaw IMRT and tangential partial-VMAT radiotherapy plans for synchronous bilateral breast cancer irradiation based on a dosimetric study.	To investigate the fixed-jaw intensity-modulated radiotherapy (F-IMRT) and tangential partial volumetric modulated arc therapy (tP-VMAT) treatment plans for synchronous bilateral breast cancer (SBBC).	Twelve SBBC patients with pTis-2N0M0 stages who underwent whole-breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery were planned with F-IMRT and tP-VMAT techniques prescribing 42.56 Gy (2.66 Gy*16f) to the breast. The F-IMRT used 8-12 jaw-fixed tangential fields with single (sF-IMRT) or two (F-IMRT) isocenters located under the sternum or in the center of the left and right planning target volumes (PTVs), and tP-VMAT used 4 tangential partial arcs with two isocenters located in the center of the left and right PTVs. Plan evaluation was based on dose-volume histogram (DVH) analysis. Dosimetric parameters were calculated to evaluate plan quality; total monitor units (MUs), and the gamma analysis for patient-specific quality assurance (QA) were also evaluated.	For PTVs, the three plans had similar Dmean and conformity index (CI) values. F-IMRT showed a slightly better target coverage according to the V100% values and demonstrated an obvious reduction in V105% and Dmax compared with the values observed for sF-IMRT and tP-VMAT. Compared with tP-VMAT, sF-IMRT was slightly better in terms of V100% , V105% and Dmax . In addition, F-IMRT achieved the best homogeneity index (HI) values for PTVs. Concerning healthy tissue, tP-VMAT had an advantage in minimizing the high dose volume. The MUs of the tP-VMAT plan were decreased approximately 1.45 and 1 times compared with the sF-IMRT and F-IMRT plans, respectively, and all plans passed QA. For the lungs, heart and liver, F-IMRT achieved the smallest values in terms of Dmean and showed a significant difference compared with tP-VMAT. Simultaneously, sF-IMRT was also superior to tP-VMAT. For the coronary artery, tP-VMAT achieved the lowest Dmean , while the value for F-IMRT was 2.24% lower compared with sF-IMRT. For all organs at risk (OARs), tP-VMAT was superior at the high dose level. In contrast, sF-IMRT and F-IMRT were obviously superior at the low dose level. The sF-IMRT and F-IMRT plans showed consistent trends.	All treatment plans for the provided techniques were of high quality and feasible for SBBC patients. However, we recommend F-IMRT with a single isocenter as a priority technique because of the tremendous advantage of local hot spot control in PTVs and the reduced dose to OARs at low dose levels. When the irradiated dose to the lungs and heart exceed the clinical restriction, two isocenter F-IMRT can be used to maximize OAR sparing. Additionally, tP-VMAT can be adopted for improving cold spots in PTVs or high-dose exposure to normal tissue when the interval between PTVs is narrow.	2019
31481582	Non invasive PET imaging of CDK4/6 activation in Breast Cancer.	The cell cycle is a progression of four distinct phases (G1, S, G2, M), with various cycle proteins being essential in regulating this process. In breast cancer, alterations in the cell cycle and uncontrolled proliferation led to several studies interrogating the relationship between cyclins and their counterpart cyclin-dependent-kinases (CDKs). We aimed to develop a radiolabeled CDK4/6 inhibitor for breast cancer imaging. Our transfluorinated analog ([18F]-CDKi) was evaluated and validated as a novel PET imaging agent to quantify CDK4/6 expression in ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer. Methods: [18F]-CDKi was synthesized and assayed for its inhibitory activities against CDK4/6 kinases. [18F]-CDKi was prepared with a 2-step automated synthetic strategy that yielded the final product with remarkable purity and molar activity. In vitro and in vivo biologic activity and specificity was assessed in a MCF-7 cell line and in mice bearing MCF-7 breast tumors. Non radioactive Palbociclib (Inbrance, Pfizer®) was used as blocking agent to investigate the binding specificity and selectivity of [18F]-CDKi. Results: To generate [18F]-CDKi, we introduced an F-18 prosthetic group (18F-fluorobenzoic acid, [18F-FBA]), and transformed palbociclib into a different, PET active functional molecule. [18F]-CDKi was obtained with an overall radiochemical uncorrected yield of 15% and radiochemical purity > 98 %. The total synthesis time from the start of synthesis to final injectable formulated tracer is 70 minutes. The retention time reported for [18F]-CDKi and [19F]-CDKi is 27.4 min as demonstrated by co-injection with [19F]-CDKi in a HPLC. The first experiments aimed to analyze pharmacokinetics (PK) and in vitro activity of [18F]-CDKi (figure 5, Blood HL). In vivo blood half-life [t1/2(weighted) = 7.03 minutes], and octanol/water phase partition coefficient (logDO/W = 1.91 ± 0.24) showed a mainly lipophilic behavior. [18F]-CDKi is stable in vitro and in vivo (>98% at 4h post injection) and maintained its potent targeting affinity to CDK4/6 (~13NM for CDK4 and ~15nM for CDK6). Cellular uptake experiments performed in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line (ER-positive/HER2-negative) demonstrated specific uptake with a maximum intracellular concentration of ~65% as early as 10 minutes post incubation. The tracer uptake was reduced to <5% when cells were co-incubated with a molar excess of Palbociclib. In vivo imaging and ex-vivo biodistribution of ER-positive/HER-2 negative MCF-7 breast cancer models showed a ~4%ID/g tumor specific uptake (reduced to ~0.3%ID/g with a 50-fold excess of cold palbociclib). A comprehensive biodistribution analysis revealed also a significantly lower activation of CDK4/6 in non-targeting organs. Conclusion: [18F]-CDKi represents the first 18F positron emission tomography (PET) CDK4/6 imaging agent and a promising imaging agent for ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer.	2019
31452065	Noninvasive Classification of Human Triple Negative Breast Cancer by PET Imaging with GRP78-Targeted Molecular Probe [68Ga]DOTA-VAP.	There is currently no effective noninvasive method for accurate molecular typing of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) except needle biopsy. Glucoregulated Protein 78 (GRP78) is overexpressed in TNBC cells and tumors which closely related to the invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance of cancer. Meanwhile, it has been verified that VAP peptide bind specifically to GRP78 in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we constructed a GRP78-targeted molecular probe Ga-68-radiolabeled DOTA-VAP conjugate ([68Ga]DOTA-VAP) based on VAP peptide, and evaluated its potential to distinguish TNBC from non-TNBC tumors.	DOTA-VAP was synthesized and then radiolabeled with Ga-68 to obtain [68Ga]DOTA-VAP. The expression of GRP78 in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and non-TNBC MCF-7 cells was validated by Western Blot, and cell binding or uptake experiments with both [68Ga]DOTA-VAP and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) were also performed. Biodistribution analysis and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of [68Ga]DOTA-VAP were carried out in subcutaneous MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 human breast cancer tumor models with [18F]FDG PET imaging as comparison.	[68Ga]DOTA-VAP was prepared with high radiochemical purity which showed excellent stability in vitro. The MDA-MB-231 tumors were clearly visualized by [68Ga]DOTA-VAP PET imaging with a low background, except for the relatively high liver uptake. Cells and tumors of MDA-MB-231 could be distinguished from MCF-7 by [68Ga]DOTA-VAP instead of [18F]FDG. Biodistribution results were consistent with the imaging results. The blocking study with excess cold peptide showed significantly reduced tumor uptake, which indicated the specificity of [68Ga]DOTA-VAP targeting MDA-MB-231 tumors in vivo.	GRP78-targeted PET imaging with [68Ga]DOTA-VAP provided an effective approach for the noninvasive accurate classification of TNBC from other breast cancer subtypes comparing with [18F]FDG. GRP78 may be a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of TNBC. For clinical transformation, efforts should be made to overcome deficiencies of [68Ga]DOTA-VAP such as relative high uptake in normal tissues.	2019
31420468	A Phase Ib Trial of Durvalumab in Combination with Trastuzumab in HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer (CCTG IND.229).	Immune checkpoint inhibitors are active in a broad range of cancers, including programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive, triple-negative, metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity is a mechanism of action of trastuzumab. We performed a phase Ib trial of durvalumab and trastuzumab in HER2-positive MBC previously treated with chemotherapy and anti-HER2 antibodies to assess safety, efficacy, and correlative endpoints.	Patients with HER2-positive MBC were enrolled on a standard 3 + 3 design. Dose level 1 was durvalumab (1,125 mg intravenously day 1) and trastuzumab (8 mg/kg intravenously loading, then 6 mg/kg day 1) on a q3 weekly cycle. An expansion cohort at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) performed tumor biopsies at baseline and after cycle 1. The primary endpoint was to establish the RP2D.	Fifteen patients were accrued from April to December 2016, of which 14 were evaluable for response. Median age was 54 years (range 40-86); the majority had visceral disease (87%) and at least three prior (adjuvant and/or metastatic) lines of chemotherapy (73%), including trastuzumab (93%), pertuzumab (60%), and trastuzumab-emtansine (93%) for MBC. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed at dose level 1 (n = 6) or dose expansion (n = 9) during cycle 1. One patient developed a grade ≥3 immune-related adverse event (grade 4 diabetes mellitus). No responses by RECIST were seen, with 4 of 14 patients (29%) demonstrating stable disease as best response at week 6 (median duration, 2.7 months). All patients had <1% PD-L1 expression on either archival tissue (7/15) or prestudy biopsy (8/15). In the dose expansion cohort, evaluable pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies (n = 5) showed minimal CD8 cell infiltration.	The RP2D of durvalumab and trastuzumab is standard full doses of both agents. No significant clinical activity was observed in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive PD-L1-negative MBC.	This phase Ib trial with associated correlative endpoints provides insights into the lack of activity of the combination of durvalumab and trastuzumab in heavily pretreated HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). No significant clinical activity was observed in patients with heavily pretreated HER2-positive programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-negative MBC with evidence of cytotoxic T-cell exhaustion. Furthermore, all patients had no expression of PD-L1 in the tumor cells. These data support the importance of PD-L1 as an important selection biomarker and the need to assess the tumor microenvironment for immune regulatory cells. Further work is needed to understand how to activate the "cold" tumors to be able to combine current immune-oncology agents.	2019
31412537	Zr-89 Immuno-PET Targeting Ectopic ATP Synthase Enables In-Vivo Imaging of Tumor Angiogenesis.	In this study, we synthesized a Zr-89-labeled anti-adenosine triphosphate synthase monoclonal antibody (ATPS mAb) for applications in immuno-positron emission tomography (PET) and evaluated its feasibility for angiogenesis imaging. The cellular uptake of Zr-89 ATPS mAb was measured after treatment of cancer cell lines in vitro, and its biodistribution was evaluated at 4, 24 and 48 h in vivo in mice bearing xenografts. PET images were acquired at 4, 24, 48, and 96 h after Zr-89 ATPS mAb administration. Tumor angiogenesis was analyzed using anti-CD31 immunofluorescence staining. The cellular uptake of Zr-89 ATPS mAb increased over time in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells but did not increase in PC3 prostate cancer cells. The tumor uptake of Zr-89 ATPS mAb at 24 h was 9.4 ± 0.9% ID/g for MDA-Mb-231 cells and was 3.8 ± 0.6% ID/g for PC3 cells (p = 0.004). Zr-89 ATPS mAb uptake in MDA-MB-231 xenografts was inhibited by the administration of cold ATPS mAb (4.4 ± 0.5% ID/g, p = 0.011). Zr-89 ATPS mAb uptake could be visualized by PET for up to 96 h in MDA-MB-231 tumors. In contrast, there was no distinct tumor uptake detected by PET in the PC3 xenograft model. CD31-positive tumor vessels were abundant in MDA-MB-231 tumors, whereas they were scarcely detected in PC3 tumors. In conclusion, ATPS mAb was successfully labeled with Zr-89, which could be used for immuno-PET imaging targeting tumor angiogenesis.	2019
31399043	Development of a new fusion-enhanced oncolytic immunotherapy platform based on herpes simplex virus type 1.	Oncolytic viruses preferentially replicate in tumors as compared to normal tissue and promote immunogenic cell death and induction of host systemic anti-tumor immunity. HSV-1 was chosen for further development as an oncolytic immunotherapy in this study as it is highly lytic, infects human tumor cells broadly, kills mainly by necrosis and is a potent activator of both innate and adaptive immunity. HSV-1 also has a large capacity for the insertion of additional, potentially therapeutic, exogenous genes. Finally, HSV-1 has a proven safety and efficacy profile in patients with cancer, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), an oncolytic HSV-1 which expresses GM-CSF, being the only oncolytic immunotherapy approach that has received FDA approval. As the clinical efficacy of oncolytic immunotherapy has been shown to be further enhanced by combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, developing improved oncolytic platforms which can synergize with other existing immunotherapies is a high priority. In this study we sought to further optimize HSV-1 based oncolytic immunotherapy through multiple approaches to maximize: (i) the extent of tumor cell killing, augmenting the release of tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) factors; (ii) the immunogenicity of tumor cell death; and (iii) the resulting systemic anti-tumor immune response.	To sample the wide diversity amongst clinical strains of HSV-1, twenty nine new clinical strains isolated from cold sores from otherwise healthy volunteers were screened across a panel of human tumor cell lines to identify the strain with the most potent tumor cell killing ability, which was then used for further development. Following deletion of the genes encoding ICP34.5 and ICP47 to provide tumor selectivity, the extent of cell killing and the immunogenicity of cell death was enhanced through insertion of a gene encoding a truncated, constitutively highly fusogenic form of the envelope glycoprotein of gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV-GP-R-). A number of further armed derivatives of this virus were then constructed intended to further enhance the anti-tumor immune response which was generated following fusion-enhanced, oncolytic virus replication-mediated cell death. These viruses expressed GMCSF, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule, CD40L, OX40L and/or 4-1BB, each of which is expected to act predominantly at the site and time of immune response initiation. Expression of these proteins was confirmed by ELISA and/or western blotting. Immunogenic cell death was assessed by measuring the levels of HMGB1 and ATP from cell free supernatants from treated cells, and by measuring the surface expression of calreticulin. GALV-GP-R- mediated cell to cell fusion and killing was tested in a range of tumor cell lines in vitro. Finally, the in vivo therapeutic potential of these viruses was tested using human A549 (lung cancer) and MDA-MB-231(breast cancer) tumor nude mouse xenograft models and systemic anti-tumor effects tested using dual flank syngeneic 4434 (melanoma), A20 (lymphoma) mouse tumor models alone and in combination with a murine anti-PD1 antibody, and 9 L (gliosarcoma) tumors in rats.	The twenty nine clinical strains of HSV-1 isolated and tested demonstrated a broad range of tumor cell killing abilities allowing the most potent strain to be identified which was then used for further development. Oncolytic ability was demonstrated to be further augmented by the expression of GALV-GP-R- in a range of tumor cell lines in vitro and in mouse xenograft models in nude mice. The expression of GALV-GP-R- was also demonstrated to lead to enhanced immunogenic cell death in vitro as confirmed by the increased release of HMGB1 and ATP and increased levels of calreticulin on the cell surface. Experiments using the rat 9 L syngeneic tumor model demonstrated that GALV-GP-R- expression increased abscopal uninjected (anenestic) tumor responses and data using mouse 4434 tumors demonstrated that virus treatment increased CD8+ T cell levels both in the injected and uninjected tumor, and also led to increased expression of PD-L1. A combination study using varying doses of a virus expressing GALV-GP-R- and mGM-CSF and an anti-murine PD1 antibody showed enhanced anti-tumor effects with the combination which was most evident at low virus doses, and also lead to immunological memory. Finally, treatment of mice with derivatives of this virus which additionally expressed anti-mCTLA-4, mCD40L, m4-1BBL, or mOX40L demonstrated enhanced activity, particularly in uninjected tumors.	The new HSV-1 based platform described provides a potent and versatile approach to developing new oncolytic immunotherapies for clinical use. Each of the modifications employed was demonstrated to aid in optimizing the potential of the virus to both directly kill tumors and to lead to systemic therapeutic benefit. For clinical use, these viruses are expected to be most effective in combination with other anti-cancer agents, in particular PD1/L1-targeted immune checkpoint blockade. The first virus from this program (expressing GALV-GP-R- and hGM-CSF) has entered clinical development alone and in combination with anti-PD1 therapy in a number of tumor types (NCT03767348).	2019
31383623	Pregnancy and Breast Cancer: Pathways to Understand Risk and Prevention.	Several studies have made strong efforts to understand how age and parity modulate the risk of breast cancer. A holistic understanding of the dynamic regulation of the morphological, cellular, and molecular milieu of the mammary gland offers insights into the drivers of breast cancer development as well as into potential prophylactic interventions, the latter being a longstanding ambition of the research and clinical community aspiring to eradicate the disease. In this review we discuss mechanisms that react to pregnancy signals, and we delineate the nuances of pregnancy-associated dynamism that contribute towards either breast cancer development or prevention. Further definition of the molecular basis of parity and breast cancer risk may allow the elaboration of tools to predict and survey those who are at risk of breast cancer development.	2019
31382579	Synergistic Effects of Melittin and Plasma Treatment: A Promising Approach for Cancer Therapy.	Melittin (MEL), a small peptide component of bee venom, has been reported to exhibit anti-cancer effects in vitro and in vivo. However, its clinical applicability is disputed because of its non-specific cytotoxicity and haemolytic activity in high treatment doses. Plasma-treated phosphate buffered saline solution (PT-PBS), a solution rich in reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) can disrupt the cell membrane integrity and induce cancer cell death through oxidative stress-mediated pathways. Thus, PT-PBS could be used in combination with MEL to facilitate its access into cancer cells and to reduce the required therapeutic dose. The aim of our study is to determine the reduction of the effective dose of MEL required to eliminate cancer cells by its combination with PT-PBS. For this purpose, we have optimised the MEL threshold concentration and tested the combined treatment of MEL and PT-PBS on A375 melanoma and MCF7 breast cancer cells, using in vitro, in ovo and in silico approaches. We investigated the cytotoxic effect of MEL and PT-PBS alone and in combination to reveal their synergistic cytological effects. To support the in vitro and in ovo experiments, we showed by computer simulations that plasma-induced oxidation of the phospholipid bilayer leads to a decrease of the free energy barrier for translocation of MEL in comparison with the non-oxidized bilayer, which also suggests a synergistic effect of MEL with plasma induced oxidation. Overall, our findings suggest that MEL in combination with PT-PBS can be a promising combinational therapy to circumvent the non-specific toxicity of MEL, which may help for clinical applicability in the future.	2019
31371347	Functional analysis of clinical BARD1 germline variants.	Germline pathogenic variants in BRCA1/2 account for one-third of familial breast cancers. The majority of BRCA1 function requires heterodimerization with BARD1. In contrast to BRCA1, BARD1 is a low-penetrance gene with an unclear clinical relevance, partly because of limited functional evidence. Using patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells, we functionally characterized two pathogenic variants (c.1833dupT, c.2099delG) and three variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) (c.73G>C, c.1217G>A, c.1918C>A). Three of these patients had breast cancers, whereas the remaining had colorectal cancers (n = 3). Both patients with pathogenic variants (c.1833dupT, c.2099delG) developed breast cancers with aggressive disease phenotypes such as triple-negative breast cancer and high cancer grades. As BARD1 encompasses multiple functional domains, including those of apoptosis and homologous recombination repair, we hypothesized that the function being impaired would correspond with the domain where the variant was located. Variants c.1918C>A, c.1833dupT, c.1217G>A, and c.2099delG, located within and proximal to apoptotic domains of ankyrin and BRCT, were associated with impaired apoptosis. Conversely, apoptosis function was preserved in c.73G>C, which was distant from the ankyrin domain. All variants displayed normal BRCA1 heterodimerization and RAD51 colocalization, consistent with their location being distal to BRCA1-and RAD51-binding domains. In view of deficient apoptosis, VUSs (c.1217G>A and c.1918C>A) may be pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. In summary, functional analysis of BARD1 VUSs requires a combination of assays and, more importantly, the use of appropriate functional assays with consideration to the variant's location.	2019
31342880	Neuropathic Pain in Taxane-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: Evidence for Exercise in Treatment.	One in 2 Canadians is expected to acquire cancer in their lifetime. Many cancers, including breast, ovarian, and lung cancer, are treated using taxane chemotherapy with curative intent. A major adverse effect with the use of taxane chemotherapeutic agents is taxane-induced peripheral neuropathy (TIPN). Both positive (spontaneous pain, heightened sensitivity with light touch, tingling, itching, burning) and negative (loss of touch, loss of hot/cold sensations, and loss of pain) sensory symptoms can be experienced in the hands and feet and worsen with increasing dose and treatment duration. The pathophysiology of TIPN is still unknown but likely involves multiple mechanisms, including microtubule impairment, neuroimmune and inflammatory changes, ion channel remodeling, impaired mitochondrial function, and genetic predisposition. This review highlights current theories on the pathophysiology for TIPN, the cellular responses thought to maintain neuropathic pain, and the growing support for exercise in the treatment and prevention of peripheral neuropathy and neuropathic pain in both animal and human models.	2019
31285596	Fragment-based discovery of a chemical probe for the PWWP1 domain of NSD3.	Here, we report the fragment-based discovery of BI-9321, a potent, selective and cellular active antagonist of the NSD3-PWWP1 domain. The human NSD3 protein is encoded by the WHSC1L1 gene located in the 8p11-p12 amplicon, frequently amplified in breast and squamous lung cancer. Recently, it was demonstrated that the PWWP1 domain of NSD3 is required for the viability of acute myeloid leukemia cells. To further elucidate the relevance of NSD3 in cancer biology, we developed a chemical probe, BI-9321, targeting the methyl-lysine binding site of the PWWP1 domain with sub-micromolar in vitro activity and cellular target engagement at 1 µM. As a single agent, BI-9321 downregulates Myc messenger RNA expression and reduces proliferation in MOLM-13 cells. This first-in-class chemical probe BI-9321, together with the negative control BI-9466, will greatly facilitate the elucidation of the underexplored biological function of PWWP domains.	2019
31211147	Human Immune System Increases Breast Cancer-Induced Osteoblastic Bone Growth in a Humanized Mouse Model without Affecting Normal Bone.	Bone metastases are prevalent in many common cancers such as breast, prostate, and lung cancers, and novel therapies for treating bone metastases are needed. Human immune system-engrafted models are used in immuno-oncology (IO) studies for subcutaneous cancer cell or patient-derived xenograft implantations that mimic primary tumor growth. Novel efficacy models for IO compounds on bone metastases need to be established. The study was performed using CIEA NOG (NOG) mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (huNOG) and age-matched immunodeficient NOG mice. Bone phenotyping was performed to evaluate baseline differences. BT-474 human breast cancer cells were inoculated into the tibia bone marrow, and cancer-induced bone changes were monitored by X-ray imaging. Bone content and volume were analyzed by dual X-ray absorptiometry and microcomputed tomography. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and the expression of immune checkpoint markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Bone phenotyping showed no differences in bone architecture or volume of the healthy bones in huNOG and NOG mice, but the bone marrow fat was absent in huNOG mice. Fibrotic areas were observed in the bone marrow of some huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors induced osteoblastic bone growth. Bone lesions appeared earlier and were larger, and bone mineral density was higher in huNOG mice. huNOG mice had a high number of human CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive T cells and CD20-positive B cells in immune-related organs. A low number of TILs and PD-1-positive cells and low PD-L1 expression were observed in the BT-474 tumors at the endpoint. This study reports characterization of the first breast cancer bone growth model in huNOG mice. BT-474 tumors represent a "cold" tumor with a low number of TILs. This model can be used for evaluating the efficacy of combination treatments of IO therapies with immune-stimulatory compounds or therapeutic approaches on bone metastatic breast cancer.	2019
31205070	Storage Conditions and Immunoreactivity of Breast Cancer Subtyping Markers in Tissue Microarray Sections.	Loss of immunoreactivity in tissue sections has been shown to occur when slide sections are stored at room temperature for prolonged periods of time. We conducted a systematic investigation to determine the extent of staining loss in various storage conditions to determine an optimal storage method. We investigated 6 antibodies that are commonly used for breast cancer subtyping in research studies with immunohistochemistry (ER, PR, HER2, CK5/6, EGFR, and Ki67) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast tissue microarrays consisting of 148 patients. Tissue microarrays were sectioned at various time points: fresh, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months before staining. Slides sectioned at each time point were stored in 5 storage conditions: desiccator, paraffin dipped, 4°C, -20°C, and -80°C. Immunohistochemistry scores were assessed over time with McNemar Test and Bowker Test of Symmetry. Desiccator storage was the only storage condition that did not show any loss in immunoreactivity for any antibody or time point in our study. Paraffin coated slides were the most difficult storage method operationally and also showed the most loss in immunoreactivity. Storing sections in a desiccator was the most effective method for minimizing immunoreactivity loss. Cold storage at 4°C is an intermediate option that is not as protective as a desiccator, but offers the advantage of being accessible to virtually all research labs.	2019
31189943	Transcriptomic profiles conducive to immune-mediated tumor rejection in human breast cancer skin metastases treated with Imiquimod.	Imiquimod is a topical toll-like-receptor-7 agonist currently used for treating basal cell carcinoma. Recently, imiquimod has demonstrated tumor regression in melanoma and breast cancer skin metastases. However, the molecular perturbations induced by imiquimod in breast cancer metastases have not been previously characterized. Here, we describe transcriptomic profiles associated with responsiveness to imiquimod in breast cancer skin metastases. Baseline and post-treatment tumor samples from patients treated with imiquimod in a clinical trial were profiled using Nanostring technology. Through an integrative analytic pipeline, we showed that tumors from patients who achieved a durable clinical response displayed a permissive microenvironment, substantiated by the upregulation of transcripts encoding for molecules involved in leukocyte adhesion and migration, cytotoxic functions, and antigen presentation. In responding patients, Imiquimod triggered a strong T-helper-1 (Th-1)/cytotoxic immune response, characterized by the coordinated upregulation of Th-1 chemokines, migration of Th-1 and cytotoxic T cells into the tumor, and activation of immune-effector functions, ultimately mediating tumor destruction. In conclusion, we have shown that topical imiquimod can induce a robust immune response in breast cancer metastases, and this response is more likely to occur in tumors with a pre-activated microenvironment. In this setting, imiquimod could be utilized in combination with other targeted immunotherapies to increase therapeutic efficacy.	2019
31165385	Imaging Sigma-1 Receptor (S1R) Expression Using Iodine-124-Labeled 1-(4-Iodophenyl)-3-(2-adamantyl)guanidine ([124I]IPAG).	Sigma-1 receptors (S1Rs) are overexpressed in almost all human cancers, especially in breast cancers. 1-(4-Iodophenyl)-3-(2-adamantyl)guanidine (IPAG) is a validated high-affinity S1R antagonist. The objective of the current study is to evaluate the potential of iodine-124-labeled IPAG ([124I]IPAG) to image S1R-overexpressing tumors.	[124I]IPAG was synthesized from a tributyltin precursor dissolved in ethanol using chloramine-T as oxidant. Purity was analyzed using HPLC. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed using the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Competitive inhibition studies were performed using haloperidol and cold IPAG. Tumors were established in athymic nude mice by injecting 107 cells subcutaneously. Mice were imaged on micro-positron emission tomography (PET) at 4, 24, 48, 72, and 144 h post i.v. injection. Biodistribution studies were performed at same time points. In vivo tracer dilution studies were performed using excess of IPAG and haloperidol. The efficacy of [124I]IPAG to image tumors was evaluated in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice as well.	[124I]IPAG was synthesized in quantitative yield and in vitro studies indicated that [124I]IPAG binding was specific to S1R. PET imaging studies in MCF7 tumor-bearing mice reveal that [124I]IPAG accumulates in tumor and is preferentially retained while clearing from non-target organs. The tumor to background increases with time, and tumors could be clearly visualized starting from 24 h post administration. Similar results were obtained in mice bearing LNCaP tumors. In vivo tracer dilution studies showed that the uptake of [124I]IPAG could be competitively inhibited by excess of IPAG and haloperidol.	[124I]IPAG was synthesized successfully in high yields, and in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate specificity of [124I]IPAG. [124I]IPAG shows specific accumulation in tumors with increasing tumor to background ratio at later time points and therefore has high potential for imaging S1R-overexpressing cancers.	2019
31120790	Ultrasound-Guided Breast Cancer Cryoablation.	OBJECTIVE. Percutaneous ultrasound-guided breast cryoablation is a minimally invasive technique that kills targeted tissue with extreme cold, requires only local anesthesia, and takes less than 45 minutes to complete. CONCLUSION. We discuss the indications for breast cryoablation, the mechanism of cell death, and types of commercially available devices; illustrate procedural technique; and review expected follow-up imaging findings in treated primary breast cancer.	2019
31099802	Scalp Cooling: Implementing a Cold Cap Program at a Community Breast Health Center.	Many patients undergoing cancer treatment experience alopecia. To support patients, scalp cooling programs can be coordinated and implemented to educate patients and their caregivers on the benefits of and best practices for using cold caps to limit the extent of hair loss. In addition, fundraising events can alleviate the cost of cold caps and ensure that the treatment is more widely available to qualified patients. This article reviews the implementation of a cold cap program at a community breast health center. The results of the program indicate that patients who receive detailed education on scalp cooling with a cold cap, as well as have a trained cold capper to assist them with using the device, have an increased chance of limiting alopecia and retaining the majority of their hair.	2019
31083559	Prospect of Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells in Enhancing Anti-Tumor Immunity of Oncolytic Herpes Viruses.	The major type I interferon-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) surround and infiltrate certain tumors like malignant melanoma, head and neck cancer, and ovarian and breast cancer. The presence of pDC in these tumors is associated with an unfavorable prognosis for the patients as long as these cells are unstimulated. Upon activation by synthetic Toll-like receptor agonists or viruses, however, pDC develop cytotoxic activities. Viruses have the additional advantage to augment cytotoxic activities of pDC via lytic replication in malignant lesions. These effects turn cold tumors into hotspots, recruiting further immune cells to the site of inflammation. Activated pDC contribute to cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens by classical dendritic cells, which induce cytotoxic T-cells in particular in the presence of checkpoint inhibitors. The modification of oncolytic herpes viruses via genetic engineering favorably affects this process through the enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, curbing of tumor blood supply, and removal of extracellular barriers for efficient viral spread. Importantly, viral vectors may contribute to stimulation of memory-type adaptive immune responses through presentation of tumor-related neo- and/or self-antigens. Eventually, both replication-competent and replication-deficient herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) may serve as vaccine vectors, which contribute to tumor regression by the stimulation of pDC and other dendritic cells in adjuvant and neo-adjuvant situations.	2019
31081222	An ego network analysis approach identified important biomarkers with an association to progression and metastasis of gastric cancer.	Gastric cancer (GC) is the fifth most common cancer type worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify gastric-related therapeutic indicators on the basis of the ego network analysis.	The microarray data related to GC was downloaded from ArrayExpress database. All human protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were downloaded from the STRING database. Ego genes were identified on the basis of PPI networks and the gene expression in GC, and then co-expression networks (ego networks) were constructed using these ego genes. On the basis of ego networks, the optimal GO terms and genes were predicted by affinity predictions and cold read predictions. Finally, the predicted genes as effective biomarkers for GC were verified by the bioinformatics analysis.	The differential expression networks were conducted and comprised of 365 edges and 232 nodes, which resulted in 218 ego genes. Although there was no significant difference in the expression of top ten ego genes among different groups of GC samples, it was eventually confirmed that top three optimal GO terms with highest cool read values were translational termination (cool read value = 0.987), translational elongation (cool read value = 0.986), and macromolecular complex disassembly (cool read value = 0.985) and top five optimal genes were UBA52, RPS27A, MAPK1, UBC, and UBB. UBA52, RPS27A, and MAPK1 were verified by the bioinformatics analysis to be related to the progression and metastasis of GC.	An ego network analysis approach is a very effective method for screening GC and the screened genes might be biomarkers for GC diagnosis and treatment.	2019
31071371	Platelets as platforms for inhibition of tumor recurrence post-physical therapy by delivery of anti-PD-L1 checkpoint antibody.	Cancer local physical therapy (PT) by using heat, cold, electrical stimulation, irradiation or ultrasound to treat tumor is accepted as alternative choice for cancer patients. However, local recurrence and metastasis after such treatments remains to be the major cause of treatment failure and mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a therapeutic strategy to inhibit local recurrence and metastasis. Inspired by the excellent inflammatory targeting ability of platelets, here we expect that the monoclonal antibody against programmed-death ligand 1 (aPDL1) engineered platelets could inhibit tumor local recurrence effectively, by facilitating transport of anti-PD-L1 antibodies to the ablated area with residue tumors. Using triple-negative breast carcinomas (4T1) bearing mouse model, we proved that antibody-coupled platelets could effectively target incompletely ablated tumor with thermal ablation (TA). We found the release of anti-PD-L1 can be triggered upon the platelets activation, together with many pro-inflammatory cytokines. The release of anti-PD-L1 is likely due to the dissociation of platelets upon the activation. Our findings approved that our platelet-based platform could facilitate the delivery of immune checkpoint antibody to tumor residues and remarkably prevent tumor recurrence after ablation. Moreover, this platelet-based delivery strategy may be extended to the targeted delivery of therapeutics post other types of local therapies including photodynamic therapy, high-intensity-focused-ultrasound ablation therapy, and even radiotherapy.	2019
31027221	UNR/CSDE1 Expression Is Critical to Maintain Invasive Phenotype of Colorectal Cancer through Regulation of c-MYC and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition.	CSDE1 (cold shock domain containing E1) gene is located upstream of the N-RAS locus, and codes for an RNA-binding protein named Upstream of N-Ras (UNR). In cancer, CSDE1 has been shown to regulate c-Fos, c-Myc, Pten, Rac1, or Vimentin. UNR/CSDE1 has been studied in breast, melanoma, pancreatic and prostate cancer. Then, the aim of this study is to evaluate the role of CSDE1/UNR in colorectal cancer progression and maintenance of aggressive phenotype. We firstly evaluated UNR/CSDE1 expression in human colon cancer derived cell lines and patient samples. Subsequently, we performed functional experiments by UNR/CSDE1 downregulation. We also evaluated UNR/CSDE1 prognostic relevance in two independent sets of patients. Not only was UNR/CSDE1 expression higher in tumor samples compared to untransformed samples, but also in colonospheres and metastatic origin cell lines than their parental and primary cell lines, respectively. Downregulation of UNR/CSDE1 reduced cell viability and migration throughout a restrain of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and increases sensitivity to apoptosis. Interestingly, high UNR/CSDE1 expression was associated with poor prognosis and correlated positively with c-MYC expression in colorectal cancer samples and cell lines. Here, we show for the first time compelling data reporting the oncogenic role of UNR/CSDE1 in human colorectal cancer.	2019
30974893	Solvent Fractionation and Acetone Precipitation for Crude Saponins from Eurycoma longifolia Extract.	Eurycoma longifolia is a popular folk medicine in South East Asia. This study was focused on saccharide-containing compounds including saponins, mainly because of their medical potentials. Different organic solvents such as ethyl acetate, butanol, and chloroform were used to fractionate the phytochemical groups, which were consequently precipitated in cold acetone. Solvent fractionation was found to increase the total saponin content based on colorimetric assay using vanillin and sulfuric acid. Ethyl acetate fraction and its precipitate were showed to have the highest crude saponins after acetone precipitation. The samples were shown to have anti-proliferative activity comparable with tamoxifen (IC50 = 110.6 µg/mL) against human breast cancer cells. The anti-proliferative activities of the samples were significantly improved from crude extract (IC50 = 616.3 µg/mL) to ethyl acetate fraction (IC50 = 185.4 µg/mL) and its precipitate (IC50 = 153.4 µg/mL). LC-DAD-MS/MS analysis revealed that the saccharide-containing compounds such as m/z 497, 610, 723, 836, and 949 were abundant in the samples, and they could be ionized in negative ion mode. The compounds consisted of 226 amu monomers with UV-absorbing property at 254 nm, and were tentatively identified as formylated hexoses. To conclude, solvent fractionation and acetone precipitation could produce saccharide-containing compounds including saponins with higher anti-proliferative activity than crude extract against MCF-7 cells. This is the first study to use non-toxic solvents for fractionation of bioactive compounds from highly complex plant extract of E. longifolia.	2019
30920670	Multi-physics modeling to study the influence of tissue compression and cold stress on enhancing breast tumor detection using microwave radiometry.	The influence of tissue compression and external thermal modulation on passive detection of breast tumors using medical microwave radiometry was investigated using multi-physics numerical modeling. A three-dimensional numerical model of the pendant breast with 10 and 6 mm diameter tumors at varying depths (15 mm, 30 mm) was analyzed at thermodynamic equilibrium using a circular waveguide as the receive antenna. The contrast in the brightness temperature, ΔTB , between the unhealthy and healthy breasts was found to be significantly more for breast compression alone, compared to thermal modulation of the tissue surface, irrespective of tissue composition, tumor size, and depth. The study also concludes that small deep-seated tumor with very low metabolic activity that is not detectable by a radiometer with 0.1 °C sensitivity could be detected under breast compression and short duration cold stress. Thus, detection of deep-seated breast tumors can be significantly improved under controlled tissue compression with an optional cold stress.

30886117	From uncertainty to pathogenicity: clinical and functional interrogation of a rare TP53 in-frame deletion.	Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a highly penetrant cancer predisposition syndrome caused by heterozygous germline mutations in the TP53 gene. Although more than 200 missense and null TP53 mutations are well established as disease-causing, little is known about the pathogenicity and cancer risks associated with small in-frame deletions. This leads to challenges in variant classification and subsequent difficulty making a molecular diagnosis. We report the genetic testing process for a pediatric patient diagnosed with an undifferentiated high-grade brain tumor following his mother's diagnosis of early-onset bilateral breast cancer. Sequential testing revealed that both harbored a heterozygous three-nucleotide deletion in exon 7 of TP53 (c.764_766delTCA; I255del), which was classified as a variant of uncertain significance. Because the maternal family history was void of any other LFS spectrum tumors, additional information was needed to effectively classify the variant. Targeted TP53 testing of the patient's maternal grandparents confirmed that neither carried the variant; this new de novo data upgraded the variant classification to likely pathogenic. To assess the impact of this mutation on the encoded p53 protein, additional in vitro analyses were performed. Structural modeling predicted that the deletion of isoleucine at codon 255 would disrupt the architecture of the DNA-binding domain, suggesting that it might negatively impact p53 function. Consistent with this notion, the I255del mutant protein exhibited significantly impaired transcriptional activity and greatly reduced growth suppressive properties, similar to more well-characterized LFS-associated p53 mutants. This report illustrates the importance of seeking additional evidence to assign proper pathogenicity classification, which enables optimal genetic counseling and medical management of individuals with LFS and their at-risk relatives.	2019
30874469	MALAT1 long non-coding RNA and breast cancer.	Non-coding RNAs are becoming major players in disease pathogenesis such as cancer. Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a nuclear enriched long non-coding RNA that is generally overexpressed in patient tumors and metastases. Overexpression of MALAT1 has been shown to be positively correlated with tumor progression and metastasis in a large number of tumor types including breast tumors. Surprisingly, a recent report by Kim et al shows a metastasis suppressive role for Malat1. Here, we discuss these results in the context of a large body of published literature that support a pro-tumorigenic role for MALAT1 in order to gain potential insights into the basis of these observed differences.	2019
30868934	Longitudinal FDG-PET scan study of brain changes in mice with cancer-induced bone pain and after morphine analgesia.	Morphine is the most commonly used drug for treating physical and psychological suffering caused by advanced cancer. Although morphine is known to elicit multiple supraspinal analgesic effects, its behavioral correlates with respect to the whole-brain metabolic activity during cancer-induced bone pain have not been elucidated. We injected 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells into the left femur bone marrow cavity of BALB/c mice. All mice developed limb use deficits, mechanical allodynia, and hypersensitivity to cold, which were effectively suppressed with morphine. Serial 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) was performed for each mouse before cancer induction (0 day), after cancer-induced bone pain was established (14 days), and during effective morphine treatment (16 days). The longitudinal FDG-PET imaging analysis demonstrated that cancer-induced bone pain increased glucose uptake in the insular cortex and hypothalamus and decreased the activity of the retrosplenial cortex. Morphine reversed the activation of the insular cortex and hypothalamus. Furthermore, morphine activated the amygdala and rostral ventromedial medulla and suppressed the activity of anterior cingulate cortex. Our findings of hypothalamic and insular cortical activation support the hypothesis that cancer-induced bone pain has strong inflammatory and affective components in freely moving animals. Morphine may provide descending inhibitory and facilitatory actions in the treatment of cancer-induced bone pain in a clinical setting.
30850915	Characterization of Cancer-Induced Nociception in a Murine Model of Breast Carcinoma.	Severe and poorly treated pain often accompanies breast cancer. Thus, novel mechanisms involved in breast cancer-induced pain should be investigated. Then, it is necessary to characterize animal models that are reliable with the symptoms and progression of the disease as observed in humans. Explaining cancer-induced nociception in a murine model of breast carcinoma was the aim of this study. 4T1 (104) lineage cells were inoculated in the right fourth mammary fat pad of female BALB/c mice; after this, mechanical and cold allodynia, or mouse grimace scale (MGS) were observed for 30 days. To determine the presence of bone metastasis, we performed the metastatic clonogenic test and measure calcium serum levels. At 20 days after tumor induction, the antinociceptive effect of analgesics used to relieve pain in cancer patients (acetaminophen, naproxen, codeine or morphine) or a cannabinoid agonist (WIN 55,212-2) was tested. Mice inoculated with 4T1 cells developed mechanical and cold allodynia and increased MGS. Bone metastasis was confirmed using the clonogenic assay, and hypercalcemia was observed 20 days after cells inoculation. All analgesic drugs reduced the mechanical and cold allodynia, while the MGS was decreased only by the administration of naproxen, codeine, or morphine. Also, WIN 55,212-2 improved all nociceptive measures. This pain model could be a reliable form to observe the mechanisms of breast cancer-induced pain or to observe the efficacy of novel analgesic compounds.	2019
30846554	Predictability of human differential gene expression.	Differential expression (DE) is commonly used to explore molecular mechanisms of biological conditions. While many studies report significant results between their groups of interest, the degree to which results are specific to the question at hand is not generally assessed, potentially leading to inaccurate interpretation. This could be particularly problematic for metaanalysis where replicability across datasets is taken as strong evidence for the existence of a specific, biologically relevant signal, but which instead may arise from recurrence of generic processes. To address this, we developed an approach to predict DE based on an analysis of over 600 studies. A predictor based on empirical prior probability of DE performs very well at this task (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, ∼0.8), indicating that a large fraction of DE hit lists are nonspecific. In contrast, predictors based on attributes such as gene function, mutation rates, or network features perform poorly. Genes associated with sex, the extracellular matrix, the immune system, and stress responses are prominent within the "DE prior." In a series of control studies, we show that these patterns reflect shared biology rather than technical artifacts or ascertainment biases. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the DE prior to data interpretation in three use cases: (i) breast cancer subtyping, (ii) single-cell genomics of pancreatic islet cells, and (iii) metaanalysis of lung adenocarcinoma and renal transplant rejection transcriptomics. In all cases, we find hallmarks of generic DE, highlighting the need for nuanced interpretation of gene phenotypic associations.	2019
30837276	Multi-Omics Profiling Reveals Distinct Microenvironment Characterization and Suggests Immune Escape Mechanisms of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.	The tumor microenvironment has a profound impact on prognosis and immunotherapy. However, the landscape of the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) microenvironment has not been fully understood.	Using the largest original multi-omics dataset of TNBC (n = 386), we conducted an extensive immunogenomic analysis to explore the heterogeneity and prognostic significance of the TNBC microenvironment. We further analyzed the potential immune escape mechanisms of TNBC.	The TNBC microenvironment phenotypes were classified into three heterogeneous clusters: cluster 1, the "immune-desert" cluster, with low microenvironment cell infiltration; cluster 2, the "innate immune-inactivated" cluster, with resting innate immune cells and nonimmune stromal cells infiltration; and cluster 3, the "immune-inflamed" cluster, with abundant adaptive and innate immune cells infiltration. The clustering result was validated internally with pathologic sections and externally with The Cancer Genome Atlas and METABRIC cohorts. The microenvironment clusters had significant prognostic efficacy. In terms of potential immune escape mechanisms, cluster 1 was characterized by an incapability to attract immune cells, and MYC amplification was correlated with low immune infiltration. In cluster 2, chemotaxis but inactivation of innate immunity and low tumor antigen burden might contribute to immune escape, and mutations in the PI3K-AKT pathway might be correlated with this effect. Cluster 3 featured high expression of immune checkpoint molecules.	Our study represents a step toward personalized immunotherapy for patients with TNBC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors might be effective for "immune-inflamed" cluster, and the transformation of "cold tumors" into "hot tumors" should be considered for "immune-desert" and "innate immune-inactivated" clusters.	2019
30833418	Circulating tumor DNA dynamics using patient-customized assays are associated with outcome in neoadjuvantly treated breast cancer.	Pathological complete response (pCR) is an accurate predictor of good outcome following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locally advanced breast cancer. The presence of circulating-tumor DNA (ctDNA) has recently been reported to be strongly predictive of poor outcome in similar patient groups. We monitored ctDNA levels from 10 women undergoing NAC for locally advanced breast cancer using a patient-specific, hybrid-capture sequencing technique sensitive to the level of one altered allele in 10,000. Plasma was collected prior to the start of NAC, prior to each infusion of NAC, and during follow-up for between 350 and 1150 d after the start of NAC. Prior to the start of NAC, ctDNA was detectable in 3/3 triple negative, 3/3 HER2+, and 2/4 HER2-, ER+ breast cancer patients. Total cell-free DNA levels were considerably higher when patients were on NAC than at other times. ctDNA dynamics during NAC showed that patients with pCR experienced rapid declines in ctDNA levels, whereas patients without pCR typically showed evidence of residual ctDNA after initiation of treatment. Intriguingly, two of three patients that showed marked increases in ctDNA while on NAC experienced rapid recurrences (<2 yr following start of NAC). The third patient that had increases in ctDNA levels while on NAC had low-grade ER+ disease and showed residual ctDNA after surgery, which became undetectable after local radiation. Taken together, these results demonstrate the ability of our approach to sensitively serially monitor ctDNA during NAC, and identifies a need to further investigate the possibility of stratifying patients who need additional treatment or identify therapies that are ineffective.	2019
30833417	Base excision repair deficiency signatures implicate germline and somatic MUTYH aberrations in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and breast cancer oncogenesis.	We report a case of early-onset pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in a patient harboring biallelic MUTYH germline mutations, whose tumor featured somatic mutational signatures consistent with defective MUTYH-mediated base excision repair and the associated driver KRAS transversion mutation p.Gly12Cys. Analysis of an additional 730 advanced cancer cases (N = 731) was undertaken to determine whether the mutational signatures were also present in tumors from germline MUTYH heterozygote carriers or if instead the signatures were only seen in those with biallelic loss of function. We identified two patients with breast cancer each carrying a pathogenic germline MUTYH variant with a somatic MUTYH copy loss leading to the germline variant being homozygous in the tumor and demonstrating the same somatic signatures. Our results suggest that monoallelic inactivation of MUTYH is not sufficient for C:G>A:T transversion signatures previously linked to MUTYH deficiency to arise (N = 9), but that biallelic complete loss of MUTYH function can cause such signatures to arise even in tumors not classically seen in MUTYH-associated polyposis (N = 3). Although defective MUTYH is not the only determinant of these signatures, MUTYH germline variants may be present in a subset of patients with tumors demonstrating elevated somatic signatures possibly suggestive of MUTYH deficiency (e.g., COSMIC Signature 18, SigProfiler SBS18/SBS36, SignatureAnalyzer SBS18/SBS36).	2019
30819377	Long-Term Risk of Heart Failure in Breast Cancer Patients After Adjuvant Chemotherapy With or Without Trastuzumab.	This study sought to evaluate the long-term risk of developing heart failure (HF) in patients receiving trastuzumab therapy.	Trastuzumab has improved the prognosis in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, but it can induce left ventricular dysfunction with reduced ejection fraction or HF during treatment. The long-term risk of HF is less well described.	In a nationwide Danish retrospective cohort study, 9,901 patients scheduled for adjuvant treatment for early-stage breast cancer were identified in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group database. Of these, 8,812 patients (25% HER2-positive; 51.7 ± 8.5 years of age) received chemotherapy including anthracycline; and if they were HER2 positive, trastuzumab was added. The primary endpoint was a diagnosis of HF assessed before and after 18 months in a landmark analysis to distinguish short- and long-term risks.	Median follow-up was 5.4 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 4.1 to 6.8 years). In the trastuzumab group, 60 patients had HF by 9 years versus 51 in the group who were treated with chemotherapy alone, corresponding to incidence rates per 1,000 patient years of 5.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.1 to 6.8) versus 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1 to 1.8), respectively. The cumulative incidence of HF was higher in the trastuzumab group at both the short- and long-term (p < 0.01), yielding adjusted hazard ratios of 8.7 (95% CI: 4.6 to 16.5; p < 0.01) for early HF and 1.9 (95% CI: 1.2 to 3.3; p = 0.01) for late HF associated with trastuzumab treatment.	Trastuzumab treatment is associated with a 2-fold increased risk of late HF compared with chemotherapy treatment alone.	2019
30813844	The "cancer-cold" hypothesis and possible extensions for the Nordic populations.	Cancer incidence is inexplicably high in cold countries. This has been revealed by recent genetic and epidemiological studies. These studies used data from the GLOBOCAN-2012 database, for 186 populations and for a variety of cancer types. Cancer incidence in Nordic people is particularly high for the frequent cancer forms, like breast, prostate and colon cancer. A relationship of cancer with cold is suspected since Inuit and Alaska Indians that live in even more extreme low temperatures have the higher cancer rates in the world. In this article, possible reasons for this phenomenon are discussed. These explanations are related with: evolutionary adaptation to extreme cold, the genetic background of Nordic people, the experimentally proven fast growth and metastasis of tumors at low temperatures, high concentration of certain air pollutants at cold environments, low levels of serum Vitamin D, overdiagnosis by the medical doctors and high quality of the health system in Nordic countries. Lifestyle parameters are not discussed in detail, although these may be equally crucial for cancer risk in cold countries. In conclusion, more studies are needed to elucidate the real causes of this epidemiological pattern.	2019
30806234	Cross-Flow Ultrafiltration Fractions of a Cold Aqueous Extract of the Shiitake Culinary-Medicinal Mushroom, Lentinus edodes (Agaricomycetes), Exhibit Apoptosis in Tumor Cells.	Lentinus edodes (shiitake) ranks among the most well-known medicinal mushrooms worldwide. Immune-modulating effects of shiitake extracts have been widely demonstrated in animals and humans. Apart from providing highly purified compounds such as lentinan, crude mushroom extracts also show antitumor activities. The direct cytotoxicity of crude preparations still requires investigation. The focus of our study lies in the molecular weight cutoff distribution of β-glucans and proteins in a cold aqueous extract from L. edodes. We applied cross-flow ultrafiltration to obtain 6 fractions with different molecular sizes. β-glucan and protein contents were quantified. We were able to show that only small amounts of β-glucans were extracted and that protein content decreases with fraction size. The cytotoxic potential of the cold aqueous preparation was demonstrated by analyzing inhibition of the growth of non-small cell lung cancer and triple-negative breast cancer cells.	2018
30774541	A preliminary study on treatment of human breast cancer xenografts with a cocktail of paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and 131I-anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (9C4).	Triple-negative breast cancer often has devastating outcomes and treatment options remain limited. Therefore, different treatment combinations are worthy of testing. The efficacy of a cocktail of paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and 131I-anti-epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) (9C4) to treat breast cancer was tested. Efficacy was tested with an MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer xenograft model. Anti-EpCAM (9C4) was demonstrated to bind to MDA-MB-231 human adenocarcinoma cells in vitro. Subsequently, mice-bearing MDA-MB-231× enografts were treated with either 131I-anti-EpCAM (9C4), unlabeled anti-EpCAM (9C4), paclitaxel, doxorubicin, or a cocktail of all of the agents. Tumor volume was measured for up to 70-day postinjection. Exponential regression was performed on tumor growth curves for each of the therapy groups. Statistical comparison of the growth constants λ of the regression models for each of the treatment groups with that of the cold antibody and control groups was done using extra sum-of-square F-tests. Biexponential clearance of 131I-anti-EpCAM (9C4) was observed with biological clearance half-times of 1.14 and 17.6 days for the first and second components, respectively. The mean growth rate of the tumors in animals treated with a cocktail of all of the agents was slower than in those treated with unlabeled anti-EpCAM (9C4) (P = 0.022). These preliminary data suggest that a cocktail of 131I-anti-EpCAM (9C4), paclitaxel, and doxorubicin may be suitable for treating breast cancers with high expression of EpCAM.
30753167	Spatially distinct tumor immune microenvironments stratify triple-negative breast cancers.	Understanding the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) promises to be key for optimal cancer therapy, especially in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Integrating spatial resolution of immune cells with laser capture microdissection gene expression profiles, we defined distinct TIME stratification in TNBC, with implications for current therapies including immune checkpoint blockade. TNBCs with an immunoreactive microenvironment exhibited tumoral infiltration of granzyme B+CD8+ T cells (GzmB+CD8+ T cells), a type 1 IFN signature, and elevated expression of multiple immune inhibitory molecules including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and resulted in good outcomes. An "immune-cold" microenvironment with an absence of tumoral CD8+ T cells was defined by elevated expression of the immunosuppressive marker B7-H4, signatures of fibrotic stroma, and poor outcomes. A distinct poor-outcome immunomodulatory microenvironment, hitherto poorly characterized, exhibited stromal restriction of CD8+ T cells, stromal expression of PD-L1, and enrichment for signatures of cholesterol biosynthesis. Metasignatures defining these TIME subtypes allowed us to stratify TNBCs, predict outcomes, and identify potential therapeutic targets for TNBC.	2019
30733278	Myosin Va interacts with the exosomal protein spermine synthase.	Myosin Va (MyoVa) is an actin-based molecular motor that plays key roles in the final stages of secretory pathways, including neurotransmitter release. Several studies have addressed how MyoVa coordinates the trafficking of secretory vesicles, but why this molecular motor is found in exosomes is still unclear. In this work, using a yeast two-hybrid screening system, we identified the direct interaction between the globular tail domain (GTD) of MyoVa and four protein components of exosomes: the WD repeat-containing protein 48 (WDR48), the cold shock domain-containing protein E1 (CSDE1), the tandem C2 domain-containing protein 1 (TC2N), and the enzyme spermine synthase (SMS). The interaction between the GTD of MyoVa and SMS was further validated in vitro and displayed a K d in the low micromolar range (3.5 ± 0.5 µM). SMS localized together with MyoVa in cytoplasmic vesicles of breast cancer MCF-7 and neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell lines, known to produce exosomes. Moreover, MYO5A knockdown decreased the expression of SMS gene and rendered the distribution of SMS protein diffuse, supporting a role for MyoVa in SMS expression and targeting.	2019
30704208	[Cold thinking in the boom of artificial intelligence].	Artificial intelligence clinical decision-support system is an important direction of artificial intelligence in the medical field. Both international and domestic researchers are exploring the application value of intelligent decision-making system in the field of cancer. But at the same time of the craze, there are still some problems in the intelligent decision-making system. Combining the work of the research groups in this field, this paper explores the current confusions and solutions, and hopes to help clinicians better understand intelligent decision-making. It is believed that with the deepening of the concept and the advancement of technology, intelligent decision-making will become a good help for doctors in the future.	2019
30670061	Combining the oncolytic peptide LTX-315 with doxorubicin demonstrates therapeutic potential in a triple-negative breast cancer model.	Immunochemotherapy, the combined use of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, has demonstrated great promise in several cancers. LTX-315 is an oncolytic peptide with potent immunomodulatory properties designed for the local treatment of solid tumors. By inducing rapid immunogenic cell death through the release of danger-associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs), LTX-315 is capable of reshaping the tumor microenvironment, turning "cold" tumors "hot" through a significant increase in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.	We investigated the potential of LTX-315 to be used in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy (doxorubicin, brand name CAELYX®) against triple-negative breast cancer in an orthotopic 4 T1 mammary fat pad model. Tumor growth curves were compared using one-way ANOVA analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparisons test, and animal survival curves were compared using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. We considered p values ≤0.05 to indicate statistical significance.	We found that LTX-315 displayed a strong additive antitumoral effect when used in combination with CAELYX®, and induced immune-mediated changes in the tumor microenvironment, followed by complete regression in the majority of animals treated. Furthermore, imaging techniques and histological examination showed that the combination induced strong local necrosis, followed by an increase in the infiltration of CD4+ and CD8+ immune cells into the tumor parenchymal tissue.	Our data demonstrate that LTX-315 is a promising combination partner with CAELYX® for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.	2019
30604728	The efficacy and tolerability of scalp cooling in preventing chemotherapy-induced alopecia in patients with breast cancer receiving anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy in an Asian setting.	Scalp cooling has been shown in several studies to be an effective method in preventing chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA). Data on the use of scalp cooling in Asian countries are limited, and evidence for its use and efficacy among our patients are not available.	The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of scalp cooling among breast cancer patients in our study population.	Consecutive breast cancer patients receiving FE75C, FE100C, FE100C-D, docetaxel75 or docetaxel, and cyclophosphamide (TC) at our treatment center were recruited and allocated to the treatment (scalp cooling, DigniCapTM system) or control group in this prospective nonrandomized controlled study. The assessment of alopecia was carried out using the World Health Organization grading system and clinical photographs.	Seventy patients were recruited, but only 25 completed the study and were evaluable for analysis. Five of 12 patients (42%) in the scalp cooling group managed to preserve hair. Two of three patients who received FE75C and TC regimens had minimal hair loss. All patients treated with FE100C had severe hair loss. Half of all patients who received scalp cooling throughout chemotherapy rated the treatment as reasonably well tolerated. The most common reason for discontinuing scalp cooling was intolerance to its side effects.	Scalp cooling is potentially effective in reducing CIA caused by docetaxel, TC, and FE75C chemotherapy regimen. However, it was not well tolerated by our study population. The dropout rate was high, and this needs to be taken into consideration when pursuing further trials in a similar setting.
30598658	The plasma peptides of ovarian cancer.	It may be possible to discover new diagnostic or therapeutic peptides or proteins from blood plasma by using liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to identify, quantify and compare the peptides cleaved ex vivo from different clinical populations. The endogenous tryptic peptides of ovarian cancer plasma were compared to breast cancer and female cancer normal controls, other diseases with their matched or normal controls, plus ice cold plasma to control for pre-analytical variation.	The endogenous tryptic peptides or tryptic phospho peptides (i.e. without exogenous digestion) were analyzed from 200 μl of EDTA plasma. The plasma peptides were extracted by a step gradient of organic/water with differential centrifugation, dried, and collected over C18 for analytical HPLC nano electrospray ionization and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) with a linear quadrupole ion trap. The endogenous peptides of ovarian cancer were compared to multiple disease and normal samples from different institutions alongside ice cold controls. Peptides were randomly and independently sampled by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Precursor ions from peptides > E4 counts were identified by the SEQUEST and X!TANDEM algorithms, filtered in SQL Server, before testing of frequency counts by Chi Square (χ2), for analysis with the STRING algorithm, and comparison of precursor intensity by ANOVA in the R statistical system with the Tukey-Kramer Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test.	Peptides and/or phosphopeptides of common plasma proteins such as HPR, HP, HPX, and SERPINA1 showed increased observation frequency and/or precursor intensity in ovarian cancer. Many cellular proteins showed large changes in frequency by Chi Square (χ2 > 60, p < 0.0001) in the ovarian cancer samples such as ZNF91, ZNF254, F13A1, LOC102723511, ZNF253, QSER1, P4HA1, GPC6, LMNB2, PYGB, NBR1, CCNI2, LOC101930455, TRPM5, IGSF1, ITGB1, CHD6, SIRT1, NEFM, SKOR2, SUPT20HL1, PLCE1, CCDC148, CPSF3, MORN3, NMI, XTP11, LOC101927572, SMC5, SEMA6B, LOXL3, SEZ6L2, and DHCR24. The protein gene symbols with large Chi Square values were significantly enriched in proteins that showed a complex set of previously established functional and structural relationships by STRING analysis. Analysis of the frequently observed proteins by ANOVA confirmed increases in mean precursor intensity in ZFN91, TRPM5, SIRT1, CHD6, RIMS1, LOC101930455 (XP_005275896), CCDC37 and GIMAP4 between ovarian cancer versus normal female and other diseases or controls by the Tukey-Kramer HSD test.	Here we show that separation of endogenous peptides with a step gradient of organic/water and differential centrifugation followed by random and independent sampling by LC-ESI-MS/MS with analysis of peptide frequency and intensity by SQL Server and R revealed significant difference in the ex vivo cleavage of peptides between ovarian cancer and other clinical treatments. There was striking agreement between the proteins discovered from cancer plasma versus previous biomarkers discovered in tumors by genetic or biochemical methods. The results indicate that variation in plasma proteins from ovarian cancer may be directly discovered by LC-ESI-MS/MS that will be a powerful tool for clinical research.	2018
30560124	Cytotoxic Activity of Fatty Acids From Antarctic Macroalgae on the Growth of Human Breast Cancer Cells.	Macroalgae are a natural source of clinically relevant molecules such as polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fatty acids. The Antarctic environment, due to its cold climate, leads to high production of these bioactive molecules. Adenocystis utricularis, Curdiea racovitzae, and Georgiella confluens from three distinct islands in the Antarctic Peninsula were collected and analyzed for their fatty acid content by gas chromatography flame ionization detection. Results revealed that the algal extracts consisted of 22 fatty acids, of which 9 were saturated, 4 were monounsaturated, and 9 were polyunsaturated (PUFA). In addition, fucosterol was identified within the lipidic extracts. The cytotoxic activity of these fatty acids was evaluated in human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231. The most notable result was the effect of PUFA on the growth inhibition of cancer cells ranging from 61.04 to 69.78% in comparison to control cells. Significant cytotoxic activity of fatty acids from A. utricularis was observed at 48 h, resulting in an inhibition of growth of more than 50% for breast cancer cells at a concentration of 100 μg/mL. A cell viability assay showed that the fatty acids from A. utricularis significantly reduced cell viability (68.7% in MCF-7 and 89% in MDA-MB-231 after 72 h of exposure). At the same time, DAPI staining demonstrated chromatin condensation, and apoptotic bodies formed in cells that were cultured with fatty acids from A. utricularis. These data indicate that fatty acids from Antarctic macroalgae have the potential to reduce the proliferation of and induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells.	2018
30470718	Deciphering cancer fibroblasts.	In this issue of JEM, Raz et al. (https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20180818) identify a subset of bone marrow-derived cells that uniquely promotes breast cancer angiogenesis and tumor growth. The existence of functional heterogeneity among stromal populations motivates further fundamental and therapeutic inquiries.	2018
30465110	Digital quantification of KI-67 in breast cancer.	Ki-67 proliferative index (Ki-67) is a predictive and prognostic factor in breast cancer (BC). However, some international committees do not recommend its use in routine practice due to insufficient clinical evidence and lack of standardisation and assessment method reproducibility. Scoring of Ki-67 by digital pathology may contribute to overcome these drawbacks. We evaluated 136 core biopsies of BC patients and calculated the correlation of Ki-67 scored by two breast pathologists with two methods, eyeballing visual assessment (EB) on the microscope and digital image analysis (DI), both assessed from hot spot areas (HS) and the average between hot and cold spot areas (AVE). Good and higher correlation between pathologists was observed for HS using DI in comparison to EB (0.861 vs. 0.828). Correlation in HS with both methods was very similar in homogeneous tumours (0.869 vs. 0.866). Lower correlation was found in heterogeneous tumours if EB was used instead of DI (0.691 vs. 0.838). Good agreement with DI in AVE areas was observed in both homogenous and heterogeneous tumours (0.898 and 0.887). Concordance of tumour molecular profiles based on Ki-67 was better using DI in comparison to EB (Kappa index, 0.589 vs. 0675). Whereas EB and DI were alike in homogeneous tumour, DI improved agreement in heterogeneous tumours, particularly in AVE areas. Subgroup analysis for tumour grades also showed improvement of correlation by DI in AVE areas in all G1/G2/G3 groups. Digital pathology using AVE method can be useful for Ki-67 scoring in daily practice, especially in heterogeneous and G2 tumours, by a substantial improvement of agreement between observers and results accuracy.	2019
30445902	Differential effect of surgical manipulation on gene expression in normal breast tissue and breast tumor tissue.	Gene expression profiles of normal and tumor tissue reflect both differences in biological processes taking place in vivo and differences in response to stress during surgery and sample handling. The effect of cold (room temperature) ischemia in the time interval between surgical removal of the specimen and freezing is described in a few studies. However, not much is known about the effect of warm (body temperature) ischemia during surgery.	Three women with primary operable breast cancer underwent in situ biopsies from normal breast and tumor tissue prior to radical mastectomy. Ex vivo biopsies from normal and tumor tissue were collected immediately after surgical excision. The putative effects on gene expression of malignancy (tumor versus normal), surgical manipulation (post- versus pre-surgical) and interaction between the two (differences in effect of surgical manipulation on tumor and normal samples) were investigated simultaneously by Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) analysis in this self-matched study.	Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) demonstrates a marked difference in effect of surgical manipulation on tumor compared to normal tissue. Interestingly, a large proportion of pathways affected by ischemia especially in tumor tissue are pathways considered to be specifically up regulated in tumor tissue compared to normal.	The results of this study suggest that a large contribution to this differential expression originates from altered response to stress in tumor cells rather than merely representing in vivo differences. It is important to bear this in mind when using gene-expression analysis to deduce biological function, and when collecting material for gene expression profiling.	2018
30426838	Expression of mitochondrial dysfunction-related genes and pathways in paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy in breast cancer survivors.	Paclitaxel is one of the most commonly used drugs to treat breast cancer. Its major dose-limiting toxicity is paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN). PIPN persists into survivorship and has a negative impact on patient's mood, functional status, and quality of life. No interventions are available to treat PIPN. A critical barrier to the development of efficacious interventions is the lack of understanding of the mechanisms that underlie PIPN. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been evaluated in preclinical studies as a hypothesized mechanism for PIPN, but clinical data to support this hypothesis are limited. The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate for differential gene expression and perturbed pathways between breast cancer survivors with and without PIPN.	Gene expression in peripheral blood was assayed using RNA-seq. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and pathways associated with mitochondrial dysfunction were identified between survivors who received paclitaxel and did (n = 25) and did not (n = 25) develop PIPN.	Breast cancer survivors with PIPN were significantly older; more likely to be unemployed; reported lower alcohol use; had a higher body mass index and poorer functional status; and had a higher number of lower extremity sites with loss of light touch, cold, and pain sensations and higher vibration thresholds. No between-group differences were found in the cumulative dose of paclitaxel received or in the percentage of patients who had a dose reduction or delay due to PIPN. Five DEGs and nine perturbed pathways were associated with mitochondrial dysfunction related to oxidative stress, iron homeostasis, mitochondrial fission, apoptosis, and autophagy.	This study is the first to provide molecular evidence that a number of mitochondrial dysfunction mechanisms identified in preclinical models of various types of neuropathic pain including chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy are found in breast cancer survivors with persistent PIPN and suggest genes for validation and as potential therapeutic targets.
30423731	Designing heparan sulfate-based biocompatible polymers and their application for intracellular stimuli-sensitive drug delivery.	Heparan sulfate (HS) is a kind of natural polysaccharides with good biocompatibility. And as drug carriers, it has some advantages compared to heparin. However, the preparation of HS is cumbersome and difficult, which limits its application in drug delivery. Here, we use modern separation technique combined with chromatography to establish a new preparation method of HS. The molecular weight and degree of dispersion of HS were (1.03 × 104 ± 107) kDa and 1.106, respectively. HS also showed low anticoagulation activity in comparison with heparin. Subsequently, novel redox-sensitive heparan sulfate-cystamine-vitamin E succinate (HS-SS-VES, HSV) micelles were designed to increase tumor selectivity and improve the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin (DOX). DOX-loaded HSV micelles (DOX/HSV) with spherical morphology had average particle size of 90-120 nm and good redox-triggered release behavior. The cell viabilities of blank micelles were >90% in both human breast cancer (MCF7) cells and African green monkey SV40-transformed kidney fibroblast (COS7) cells. However, the cytotoxicity of DOX/HSV in MCF7 cells was higher than that of COS7 cells. Flow cytometry analyses and confocal laser scanning microscopy observation indicated that DOX/HSV micelles were internalized by endocytosis, and then the drug was released quickly and entered the nuclei of tumor cells. The results demonstrate that high-purity HS can be prepared and has the potential to be further used for drug delivery in antitumor applications.	2019
30387137	The antiproliferative effects of cold atmospheric plasma-activated media on different cancer cell lines, the implication of ozone as a possible underlying mechanism.	Recent studies have proven several promising anticancer activities for cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) against a wide range of cancer cells in vitro. Recently, media treated with CAP have also found to effectively eradicate cancer cells similar to the CAP. Based on advantages, many researchers prefer to apply CAP-activated media (PAM) as an alternative to cap in the treatment of cancer. However, less has been achieved regarding the anticancer effects and anticancer mechanisms of PAM. Investigating the selective anticancerous activities of PAM, the viability of SKBR3, MCF7, ASPC-1, A-549, G-292, and SW742 cancer cell lines, as well as normal human skin fibroblasts (FMGB-1) and MCF10A cells in relation to the media activation time, and the length of exposure was studied. Also, we examined the concentration of ozone in media as a function to CAP activation time since recent studies have proposed ozone as a pivotal reactive species in the induction of cell death. Based on the result, both increasing the duration of media activation time and the length of exposure to PAM could significantly increase the anticancer activity. Nevertheless, the cytotoxicity on normal cells was either not affected or slightly increased. Among the six tested cancer cell lines, SW742 was the most resistant and SKBR3 the most susceptible cancer cell lines to PAM. Also, increasing duration of treatment with CAP resulted in a significant rise in O3 concentration levels in media. Overall, these results suggest PAM, as a promising tool in the treatment of different cancers and O 3 formation as a probable underlying mechanism.	2019
30386679	Tumor mutational burden is a determinant of immune-mediated survival in breast cancer.	Mounting evidence supports a role for the immune system in breast cancer outcomes. The ability to distinguish highly immunogenic tumors susceptible to anti-tumor immunity from weakly immunogenic or inherently immune-resistant tumors would guide development of therapeutic strategies in breast cancer. Genomic, transcriptomic and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) breast cancer cohorts were used to examine statistical associations between tumor mutational burden (TMB) and the survival of patients whose tumors were assigned to previously-described prognostic immune subclasses reflecting favorable, weak or poor immune-infiltrate dispositions (FID, WID or PID, respectively). Tumor immune subclasses were associated with survival in patients with high TMB (TMB-Hi, P < 0.001) but not in those with low TMB (TMB-Lo, P = 0.44). This statistical relationship was confirmed in the METABRIC cohort (TMB-Hi, P = 0.047; TMB-Lo, P = 0.39), and also found to hold true in the more-indolent Luminal A tumor subtype (TMB-Hi, P = 0.011; TMB-Lo, P = 0.91). In TMB-Hi tumors, the FID subclass was associated with prolonged survival independent of tumor stage, molecular subtype, age and treatment. Copy number analysis revealed the reproducible, preferential amplification of chromosome 1q immune-regulatory genes in the PID immune subclass. These findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for TMB as a determinant of immune-mediated survival of breast cancer patients and identify candidate immune-regulatory mechanisms associated with immunologically cold tumors. Immune subtyping of breast cancers may offer opportunities for therapeutic stratification.	2018
30375908	Treatment of advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer with new targeted agents in combination with endocrine therapy: a review of efficacy and tolerability based on available randomized trials on everolimus, ribociclib, palbociclib and abemaciclib.	Recently, new targeted agents have been developed, which can prolong the effect of endocrine treatment (ET) by targeting resistance pathways in HR+/HER2- advanced breast cancer. This review examines available studies of everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, and the CDK 4/6 inhibitors ribociclib, palbociclib and abemaciclib in terms of efficacy, tolerability and safety.	A systematic literature search was performed in Pubmed. Evaluation of the quality of the identified studies was based on selected elements from the GRADE guidelines.	The literature search yielded eight randomized trials that all presented a significant increase in the progression free survival (PFS)/time to progression (TTP) for the targeted agents plus ET vs ET only. The improvement was evident as first-line therapy with an increase in PFS of 10-11 months when adding a CDK4/6 inhibitor to ET, as well as in patients previously treated for metastatic disease, with an increase of 5-6 months. The common adverse events (AEs) of the CDK 4/6 inhibitors were due to myelosuppression. In addition, abemaciclib was associated with liver toxicity and diarrhea, and ribociclib with liver toxicity and QTcF prolongation. The most common grade 3/4 AE of everolimus was stomatitis. The majority (five) of the trials had no serious limitations, and thus the quality of evidence was high.	The new targeted agents are all associated with an improvement of the PFS with an acceptable tolerability, and they should be offered to women with advanced HR+/HER2- breast cancer both as first-line therapy as well as among patients previously treated in metastatic regimens. However, further data regarding the impact on overall survival are required to evaluate the full benefit for patients. Price and differences in AEs could become substantial arguments for the choice of therapy for the individual patient.	2019
30362262	Spatial distribution of mammography adherence in a Swiss urban population and its association with socioeconomic status.	Local physical and social environment has a defining influence on individual behavior and health-related outcomes. However, it remains undetermined if its impact is independent of individual socioeconomic status. In this study, we evaluated the spatial distribution of mammography adherence in the state of Geneva (Switzerland) using individual-level data and assessed its independence from socioeconomic status (SES).	Georeferenced individual-level data from the population-based cross-sectional Bus Santé study (n = 5002) were used to calculate local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and investigate the spatial dependence of mammography adherence. Spatial clusters are reported without adjustment; adjusted for neighborhood income and individual educational attainment; and demographic factors (age and Swiss nationality). The association between adjusted clusters and the proximity to the nearest screening center was also evaluated.	Mammography adherence was not randomly distributed throughout Geneva with clusters geographically coinciding with known SES distributions. After adjustment for SES indicators, clusters were reduced to 56.2% of their original size (n = 1033). Adjustment for age and nationality further reduced the number of individuals exhibiting spatially dependent behavior (36.5% of the initial size). The identified SES-independent hot spots and cold spots of mammography adherence were not explained by proximity to the nearest screening center.	SES and demographic factors play an important role in shaping the spatial distribution of mammography adherence. However, the spatial clusters persisted after confounder adjustment indicating that additional neighborhood-level determinants could influence mammography adherence and be the object of targeted public health interventions.	2018
30360692	Tamoxifen suppresses paclitaxel-, vincristine-, and bortezomib-induced neuropathy via inhibition of the protein kinase C/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway.	Chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is a highly problematic, dose-limiting effect of potentially curative regimens of cancer chemotherapy. When neuropathic pain is severe, patients often either switch to less-effective chemotherapy agents or choose to discontinue chemotherapy entirely. Conventional chemotherapy drugs used to treat lung and breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma include paclitaxel, vincristine, and bortezomib. Approximately 68% of patients receiving these anticancer drugs develop neuropathy within the first month of treatment, and while strategies to prevent chemotherapy-induced neuropathy have been investigated, none have yet been proven as effective. Recent reports suggest that chemotherapy-induced neuropathy is associated with signal transduction molecules, including protein kinase C and mitogen-activated protein kinases. It is currently unclear whether protein kinase C inhibition can prevent chemotherapy-induced neuropathy. In this study, we found that tamoxifen, a protein kinase C inhibitor, suppressed paclitaxel-, vincristine-, and bortezomib-induced cold and mechanical allodynia in mice. In addition, chemotherapy drugs induce neuropathy via the protein kinase C/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in the spinal cord in lumbar segments 4-6 and dorsal root ganglions. In addition, tamoxifen was shown to act synergistically with paclitaxel to inhibit tumor-growth in mice injected with tumor cells. Our results indicated that paclitaxel-, vincristine-, and bortezomib-induced neuropathies were associated with the protein kinase C/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway in the lumbar spinal cord and dorsal root ganglions, which suggest that protein kinase C inhibitors may be therapeutically effective for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced neuropathy when administered with standard chemotherapy agents.	2018
30323094	Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy in Breast Cancer.	Initial studies investigating single-agent activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) serve as proof of principle that harnessing the immune system can have anticancer activity in a variety of human malignancies. Although breast cancer was historically believed to be immunogenically silent, early studies indicate overall response rates with ICIs are similar to those observed with many other solid malignancies. Overall response rates in advanced breast cancer are low, but the responses are remarkably durable. A deeper understanding of the biology of the interaction between cancer and immune cells is required to both develop biomarkers that more accurately predict response to therapy and identify effective immunotherapy-based combination strategies that can enhance the immunogenicity of biologically "cold" tumors. Breast cancer encompasses a variety of diseases defined by the presence or absence of central oncogenic drivers, and early data suggest that the distinct subtypes may have unique immune phenotypes. Breast cancer represents an ideal disease in which to investigate immunotherapeutic strategies given the prevalence of the disease, unique clinical trial design opportunities, and immunophenotypic diversity.	2018
30234699	What makes surgical nerve injury painful? A 4-year to 9-year follow-up of patients with intercostobrachial nerve resection in women treated for breast cancer.	Nerve injury during breast cancer surgery can cause neuropathic pain (NP). It is not known why some, but not all, patients develop chronic postsurgical neuropathic pain (CPSNP) after the same nerve injury. In this study, we examined 251 breast cancer survivors with surgeon-verified intercostobrachial nerve resection to identify factors that associate with CPSNP. The patients were recruited from a previous study of 1000 women treated for breast cancer in 2006 to 2010. This enabled us to analyze preoperative factors that associate with future CPSNP. The patients were re-examined in 2014 to 2016 to diagnose CPSNP using the revised NP diagnostic criteria. Preoperative assessments were pain in the area to be operated on, any chronic pain condition, depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep, and experimental cold pain sensitivity using the cold pressor test (CPT). Follow-up assessments were CPT, psychological factors, sleep, any chronic pain, and basic laboratory tests. One hundred thirty-seven (55%) patients with intercostobrachial nerve resection fulfilled CPSNP diagnostic criteria after 4 to 9 years. Of them, 30 patients (22%) had moderate to severe pain in self-reports and 86 (63%) presented moderate to severe evoked pain at examination. Preoperative pain in the surgical area, other chronic pains, and breast-conserving surgery were associated with future CPSNP. Other chronic pains, increased psychological burden, and insomnia, both before surgery and at the follow-up, were associated with CPSNP. Preoperative CPT did not associate with future CPSNP. Patients with established CPSNP showed increased pain sensitivity in CPT and higher levels of inflammatory markers, suggesting that central sensitization and inflammation may associate with the maintenance of CPSNP.	2019
30221036	Heating it up: Oncolytic viruses make tumors 'hot' and suitable for checkpoint blockade immunotherapies.	Immune checkpoint blockade is less efficient in patients bearing immunologically 'cold' tumors. Oncolytic viruses, which were originally discovered for their ability to preferentially kill malignant cells, can recondition the tumor microenvironment. Supporting this hypothesis, two new studies published in Science Translational Medicine show that adjuvant-like activities of oncolytic viruses make brain and breast tumors 'hot' and sensitize them for subsequent immune checkpoint blockade.	2018
30172061	Phenotypic Characterization of Paclitaxel-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy in Cancer Survivors.	Although paclitaxel is one of the most commonly used drugs to treat breast, ovarian, and lung cancers, little is known about the impact of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PIPN) on cancer survivors.	The purposes of this study were to evaluate for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics as well as measures of sensation, balance, upper extremity function, perceived stress, symptom burden, and quality of life (QOL) between survivors who received paclitaxel and did (n = 153) and did not (n = 58) develop PIPN.	Pain characteristics associated with PIPN are described in detail. Both subjective and objective measures were used to evaluate the impact of PIPN.	Survivors with PIPN were significantly older, had a higher body mass index, and a worse comorbidity profile. The duration of PIPN was almost four years, and pain scores were in the moderate range. Compared with survivors without PIPN, survivors with PIPN had a higher number of upper and lower extremity sites that had lost light touch, cold, and pain sensations. Survivors with PIPN had worse upper extremity function, more problems with balance, a higher symptom burden, and higher levels of perceived stress. In addition, survivors with PIPN had worse QOL scores particularly in the domain of physical functioning.	The findings from this large descriptive study are the first to document the impact of PIPN on survivors' symptom burden, functional status, and QOL.	2018
30157705	ZLc002, a putative small-molecule inhibitor of nNOS interaction with NOS1AP, suppresses inflammatory nociception and chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and synergizes with paclitaxel to reduce tumor cell viability.	Elevated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activity contributes to central sensitization. Our laboratories and others recently reported that disrupting protein-protein interactions downstream of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors suppresses pain. Specifically, disrupting binding between the enzyme neuronal nitric oxide synthase and either its upstream (postsynaptic density 95 kDa, PSD95) or downstream (e.g. nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein, NOS1AP) protein partners suppressed inflammatory and/or neuropathic pain. However, the lack of a small-molecule neuronal nitric oxide synthase-NOS1AP inhibitor has hindered efforts to validate the therapeutic utility of disrupting the neuronal nitric oxide synthase-NOS1AP interface as an analgesic strategy. We, therefore, evaluated the ability of a putative small-molecule neuronal nitric oxide synthase-NOS1AP inhibitor ZLc002 to disrupt binding between neuronal nitric oxide synthase and NOS1AP using ex vivo, in vitro, and purified recombinant systems and asked whether ZLc002 would suppress inflammatory and neuropathic pain in vivo. In vitro, ZLc002 reduced co-immunoprecipitation of full-length NOS1AP and neuronal nitric oxide synthase in cultured neurons and in HEK293T cells co-expressing full-length neuronal nitric oxide synthase and NOS1AP. However, using a cell-free biochemical binding assay, ZLc002 failed to disrupt the in vitro binding between His-neuronal nitric oxide synthase1-299 and glutathione S-transferase-NOS1AP400-506, protein sequences containing the required binding domains for this protein-protein interaction, suggesting an indirect mode of action in intact cells. ZLc002 (4-10 mg/kg i.p.) suppressed formalin-evoked inflammatory pain in rats and reduced Fos protein-like immunoreactivity in the lumbar spinal dorsal horn. ZLc002 also suppressed mechanical and cold allodynia in a mouse model of paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain. Anti-allodynic efficacy was sustained for at least four days of once daily repeated dosing. ZLc002 also synergized with paclitaxel when administered in combination to reduce breast (4T1) or ovarian (HeyA8) tumor cell line viability but did not alter tumor cell viability without paclitaxel. Our results verify that ZLc002 disrupts neuronal nitric oxide synthase-NOS1AP interaction in intact cells and demonstrate, for the first time, that systemic administration of a putative small-molecule inhibitor of neuronal nitric oxide synthase-NOS1AP suppresses inflammatory and neuropathic pain.
30123948	Rapid extraction of the hottest or coldest regions of medical thermographic images.	Early detection of breast tumors, feet pre-ulcers diagnosing in diabetic patients, and identifying the location of pain in patients are essential to physicians. Hot or cold regions in medical thermographic images have potential to be suspicious. Hence extracting the hottest or coldest regions in the body thermographic images is an important task. Lazy snapping is an interactive image cutout algorithm that can be applied to extract the hottest or coldest regions in the body thermographic images quickly with easy detailed adjustment. The most important advantage of this technique is that it can provide the results for physicians in real time readily. In other words, it is a good interactive image segmentation algorithm since it has two basic characteristics: (1) the algorithm produces intuitive segmentation that reflects the user intent with given a certain user input and (2) the algorithm is efficient enough to provide instant visual feedback. Comparing to other methods used by the authors for segmentation of breast thermograms such as K-means, fuzzy c-means, level set, and mean shift algorithms, lazy snapping was more user-friendly and could provide instant visual feedback. In this study, twelve test cases were presented and by applying lazy snapping algorithm, the hottest or coldest regions were extracted from the corresponding body thermographic images. The time taken to see the results varied from 7 to 30 s for these twelve cases. It was concluded that lazy snapping was much faster than other methods applied by the authors such as K-means, fuzzy c-means, level set, and mean shift algorithms for segmentation. Graphical abstract Time taken to implement lazy snapping algorithm to extract suspicious regions in different presented thermograms (in seconds). In this study, ten test cases are presented that by applying lazy snapping algorithm, the hottest or coldest regions were extracted from the corresponding body thermographic images. The time taken to see the results varied from 7 to 30 s for the ten cases. It concludes lazy snapping is much faster than other methods applied by the authors.	2019
30109561	A Comparison Between Full-COLD PCR/HRM and PCR Sequencing for Detection of Mutations in Exon 9 of PIK3CA in Breast Cancer Patients.	One of the most common somatic mutations in breast cancer is found in PIK3CA with a prevalence rate of 18-45%. Different variants of this gene are considered as resistance markers for treatment with HER2-targeted medicines. Conventional molecular methods such as Sanger sequencing are not able to detect mutations with low abundance in a mixture of wild-type DNA, especially in the early stages of cancer development. In this study, two methods of co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature PCR (COLD-PCR) and high-resolution melting (HRM) were combined for detection of mutations in exon 9 of PIK3CA; DNA, therefore, was extracted from MCF-7 and BT-474 as mutant and wild-type cell lines respectively. Thereafter, serial dilutions of extracted DNA were used to determine sensitivity of full-COLD PCR/HRM in comparison with conventional PCR sequencing as the gold standard method. Cell line experiments resulted in almost 30 fold increase in sensitivity by use of full-COLD PCR/HRM. In addition, 40 patients with primary breast cancer were investigated with the mentioned methods. As a result of this part of study, four mutations were detected by conventional PCR sequencing including E542K and E545K mutations in three and one samples respectively. Whereas, full-COLD PCR/HRM was able to detect one E542K mutation more than gold standard method which caused the percentage of sensitivity to get improved by 2.5% (10 to 12.5%). Our results clearly demonstrated that full-COLD PCR/HRM could detect lower levels of mutations in wild-type background as a sensitive method with simple and cost-effective procedure; therefore, it can prospectively be used in screening of patients with early-stage breast cancers.	2019
30096431	ChIP-seq analysis reveals alteration of H3K4 trimethylation occupancy in cancer-related genes by cold atmospheric plasma.	Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has gained attention for use in cancer treatment owing to its ability to preferentially induce cancer cell death; however, the involved molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Herein, an epigenetic effect of CAP on cancer cells was examined by performing a genome-wide ChIP-seq for H3K4me3 in MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Consequently, 899 genes showed significantly changed methylation level at H3K4 with constructing "Cellular Compromise, DNA Replication, Recombination, Repair, and Cell Cycle" as the top network. Comparisons with expression array data revealed a coincidence between histone modification and gene expression for 18 genes, and the association was confirmed by ChIP-PCR and qRT-PCR for selected genes. The expression of the affected genes, such as HSCB and PRPS1, was recovered when a histone demethylase JARID1A was inhibited. Furthermore, JARID1A was induced by CAP via the reactive oxygen species signaling. The two genes are known as oncogenes and show a higher expression in breast cancer tissue, and this was supported by the decreased colony formation ability of MCF-7 cells when the cells were treated with siRNAs against each gene. Taken together, these data indicate that CAP inhibits cancer cell proliferation by modulating the methylation level of H3K4 corresponding to oncogenes.	2018
30085935	Ultrasound-Guided Midpoint Transverse Process to Pleura Block in Breast Cancer Surgery: A Case Report.	To avoid the safety issues related to thoracic paravertebral blocks, we performed midpoint transverse process to pleura blocks in 3 patients before general anesthesia for modified radical mastectomies. The midpoint transverse process to pleura blocks served as the major component of multimodal analgesia. With ultrasound guidance, 7 mL of a mixture of 0.75% ropivacaine and 2% lidocaine with epinephrine were deposited at T2, T4, and T6 levels. We noted decreased sensation to cold and pinprick from T2 to T8 dermatome level with sparing of axilla and infraclavicular areas. The maximum pain numeric rating scale score (0-10) was 4 out on movement and none had mean 24-hour numeric rating scale >3.	2019

30068732	Germline SDHA mutations in children and adults with cancer.	Mutations in succinate dehydrogenase complex genes predispose to familial paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma syndrome (FPG) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Here we describe cancer patients undergoing agnostic germline testing at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and found to harbor germline SDHA mutations. Using targeted sequencing covering the cancer census genes, we identified 10 patients with SDHA germline mutations. Cancer diagnoses for these patients carrying SDHA germline mutations included neuroblastoma (n = 1), breast (n = 1), colon (n = 1), renal (n = 1), melanoma and uterine (n = 1), prostate (n = 1), endometrial (n = 1), bladder (n = 1), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) (n = 2). Immunohistochemical staining and assessment of patient tumors for second hits and loss of heterozygosity in SDHA confirmed GIST as an SDHA-associated tumor and suggests SDHA germline mutations may be a driver in neuroblastoma tumorigenesis.	2018
29976229	Syndecan-1 induction in lung microenvironment supports the establishment of breast tumor metastases.	Syndecan-1 (Sdc1), a cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan normally expressed primarily by epithelia and plasma cells, is aberrantly induced in stromal fibroblasts of breast carcinomas. Stromal fibroblast-derived Sdc1 participates in paracrine growth stimulation of breast carcinoma cells and orchestrates stromal extracellular matrix fiber alignment, thereby creating a migration and invasion-permissive microenvironment. Here, we specifically tested the role of stromal Sdc1 in metastasis.	The metastatic potential of the aggressive mouse mammary carcinoma cell lines, 4T1 and E0776, was tested in wild-type and genetically Sdc1-deficient host animals. Metastatic lesions were characterized by immunohistochemical analysis.	After orthotopic inoculation, the lung metastatic burden was reduced in Sdc1-/- animals by 97% and more than 99%, in BALB/cJ and C57BL/6 animals, respectively. The difference in metastatic efficiency was maintained when the tumor cells were injected into the tail vein, suggesting that host Sdc1 exerts its effect during later stages of the metastatic cascade. Co-localization studies identified Sdc1 expression in stromal fibroblasts within the metastatic microenvironment and in normal airway epithelial cells but not in other cells (endothelial cells, α-smooth muscle actin positive cells, leucocytes, macrophages). The Ki67 proliferation index and the rate of apoptosis of the metastatic tumor cells were diminished in Sdc1-/- vs. Sdc1+/+ animals, and leucocyte density was indistinguishable. Sdc1-mediated metastatic efficiency was abolished when the animals were housed at a thermoneutral ambient temperature of 31 °C, suggesting that the host Sdc1 effect on metastasis requires mild cold stress.	In summary, Sdc1 is induced in the lung microenvironment after mammary carcinoma cell dissemination and promotes outgrowth of metastases in a temperature-dependent manner.	2018
29962684	Dosimetric Comparison of Irregular Surface Compensator and Field-in-Field for Whole Breast Radiotherapy.	The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the dosimetric benefits of the irregular surface compensator (ISC) technique for whole breast radiotherapy compared with the field-in-field (FIF) technique.	Radiotherapy was planned using both techniques in 50 breast cancer patients (25 left sided and 25 right sided). The Eclipse treatment planning system (Varian Medical Systems) was used for dose calculations. For the FIF technique, subfields were added to the main fields to reduce hot and cold regions; for the ISC technique, the fluence editor application was used to extend the optimal fluence. Planning target volume dose, dose homogeneity index (DHI), maximum dose, ipsilateral lung, and heart doses for the left breast irradiation and monitor unit (MU) counts required for treatment were compared between the two techniques.	Compared with the FIF technique, the ISC technique significantly decreased DHI values and volumes receiving >105% of the prescription dose, and increased volumes receiving >95% of the dose and MU count (P < 0.01 for all comparisons). For the heart and ipsilateral lung, the FIF technique significantly reduced volumes receiving >5 Gy compared with the ISC technique (P < 0.01); however, volumes receiving >10, 20, and 30 Gy and the values of a mean dose did not differ significantly between the techniques (P > 0.05).	The ISC technique is preferred over the FIF technique.
29954844	Complex rearrangements and oncogene amplifications revealed by long-read DNA and RNA sequencing of a breast cancer cell line.	The SK-BR-3 cell line is one of the most important models for HER2+ breast cancers, which affect one in five breast cancer patients. SK-BR-3 is known to be highly rearranged, although much of the variation is in complex and repetitive regions that may be underreported. Addressing this, we sequenced SK-BR-3 using long-read single molecule sequencing from Pacific Biosciences and develop one of the most detailed maps of structural variations (SVs) in a cancer genome available, with nearly 20,000 variants present, most of which were missed by short-read sequencing. Surrounding the important ERBB2 oncogene (also known as HER2), we discover a complex sequence of nested duplications and translocations, suggesting a punctuated progression. Full-length transcriptome sequencing further revealed several novel gene fusions within the nested genomic variants. Combining long-read genome and transcriptome sequencing enables an in-depth analysis of how SVs disrupt the genome and sheds new light on the complex mechanisms involved in cancer genome evolution.	2018
29924804	Reporters to mark and eliminate basal or luminal epithelial cells in culture and in vivo.	The contribution of basal and luminal cells to cancer progression and metastasis is poorly understood. We report generation of reporter systems driven by either keratin-14 (K14) or keratin-8 (K8) promoter that not only express a fluorescent protein but also an inducible suicide gene. Transgenic mice express the reporter genes in the right cell compartments of mammary gland epithelia and respond to treatment with toxins. In addition, we engineered the reporters into 4T1 metastatic mouse tumor cell line and demonstrate that K14+ cells, but not K14- or K8+, are both highly invasive in three-dimensional (3D) culture and metastatic in vivo. Treatment of cells in culture, or tumors in mice, with reporter-targeting toxin inhibited both invasive behavior and metastasis in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), secretome, and epigenome analysis of K14+ and K14- cells led to the identification of amphoterin-induced protein 2 (Amigo2) as a new cell invasion driver whose expression correlated with decreased relapse-free survival in patients with TP53 wild-type (WT) breast cancer.	2018
29924336	Effects of Cryotherapy on Objective and Subjective Symptoms of Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathy: Prospective Self-Controlled Trial.	Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a dose-limiting and disabling side effect of taxane anticancer agents. We prospectively evaluated the efficacy of cryotherapy for CIPN prevention.	Breast cancer patients treated weekly with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 for one hour) wore frozen gloves and socks on the dominant side for 90 minutes, including the entire duration of drug infusion. Symptoms on the treated sides were compared with those on the untreated (nondominant) sides. The primary end point was CIPN incidence assessed by changes in tactile sensitivity from pretreatment baseline in a monofilament test at a cumulative dose of 960 mg/m2. We also assessed thermosensory deficits, subjective symptoms (Patient Neuropathy Questionnaire [PNQ]), manipulative dexterity, and the time to events and hazard ratio by PNQ. All statistical tests were two-sided.	Among the 40 patients, four did not reach the cumulative dose (due to the occurrence of pneumonia, severe fatigue, severe liver dysfunction, and macular edema), leaving 36 patients for analysis. None dropped out due to cold intolerance. The incidence of objective and subjective CIPN signs was clinically and statistically significantly lower on the intervention side than on the control (hand: tactile sensitivity = 27.8% vs 80.6%, odds ratio [OR] = 20.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.20 to 828.96, P < .001; foot: tacile sensitivity = 25.0% vs 63.9%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; hand: warm sense = 8.8% vs 32.4%, OR = 9.00, 95% CI = 1.25 to 394.48, P = .02; foot: warm sense: 33.4% vs 57.6%, OR = 5.00, 95% CI = 1.07 to 46.93, P = .04; hand: PNQ = 2.8% vs 41.7%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 3.32 to infinite, P < .001; foot: PNQ = 2.8% vs 36.1%, OR = infinite, 95% CI = 2.78 to infinite, P < .001; hand: hazard ratio [HR] = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.34; foot: HR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.38, dexterity mean delay = -2.5 seconds, SD = 12.0 seconds, vs + 8.6 seconds, SD = 25.8 seconds, P = .005).	Cryotherapy is useful for preventing both the objective and subjective symptoms of CIPN and resultant dysfunction.	2018
29888137	Molecular attributes and apoptosis-inducing activities of a putative serine protease isolated from Tiger Milk mushroom (Lignosus rhinocerus) sclerotium against breast cancer cells in vitro.	The highly valued medicinal tiger milk mushroom (also known as Lignosus rhinocerus) has the ability to cure numerous ailments. Its anticancer activities are well explored, and recently a partially purified cytotoxic protein fraction termed F5 from the mushroom's sclerotial cold water extract consisting mainly of fungal serine proteases was found to exhibit potent selective cytotoxicity against a human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF7) with IC50 value of 3.00 μg/ml. However, characterization of its cell death-inducing activity has yet to be established.	The mechanism involved in the cytotoxic activities of F5 against MCF7 cells was elucidated by flow cytometry-based apoptosis detection, caspases activity measurement, and expression profiling of apoptosis markers by western blotting. Molecular attributes of F5 were further mined from L. rhinocerus's published genome and transcriptome for future exploration.	Apoptosis induction in MCF7 cells by F5 may involve a cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways with upregulation of caspase-8 and -9 activities and a marked decrease of Bcl-2. On the other hand, the levels of pro-apoptotic Bax, BID, and cleaved BID were increased accompanied by observable actin cleavage. At gene level, F5 composed of three predicted non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (T > C) and an alternative 5' splice site.	Findings from this study provide an advanced framework for further investigations on cancer therapeutics development from L. rhinocerus.	2018
29870749	Cold atmospheric plasma conveys selectivity on triple negative breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.	Breast cancers are heterogeneous, with the triple negative subtype being the most aggressive and lack of effective therapy. Cold atmospheric plasma has become a promising onco-therapeutic approach as demonstrated by many pre-clinical studies. We found from both in vitro and in vivo experiments that plasma-activated medium could selectively induce the apoptosis, inhibit the proliferation and migration of triple negative breast cancers rather than the other subtypes. We propose that it is the accelerated genome mutation rate, hyper-activated MAPK/JNK and NF-kB pathways of triple negative breast cancers that make them more vulnerable to plasma treatment than non-triple negative tumors, and MAPK/JNK and NF-κB signalings in response to reactive oxygen species generated by plasma that play deterministic roles in this differential therapeutic response. Our work contributes in establishing a correlation between plasma efficacy and cancer subtypes, which facilitates the clinical translation of plasma as a precision medicinal approach.	2018
29863183	Liver resection combined with inferior vena cava resection and reconstruction using artificial vascular graft: A literature review.	In cases where liver tumors invade the inferior vena cava (IVC), IVC resection along with liver resection may be needed to effect a cure. Furthermore, if the IVC defect is large, IVC reconstruction with vascular graft after resection is required. There are limited reports of cases of IVC reconstruction using a graft. By reviewing data from the literature of previous studies, the present study was aimed at investigating the surgical outcomes of liver resection with IVC resection and reconstruction using an artificial vascular graft. PubMed was searched for previous articles reporting cases with the combined surgery. The search was limited to articles in English, and cases with exceptional surgeries such as in situ cold perfusion, and ante situm and ex vivo techniques were excluded from this study. Surgical outcomes of the extracted cases were investigated. Cases dealt only with primary closure after IVC resection, and those in which the IVC tumor thrombus was treated by opening the IVC wall, removing the thrombus and then closing the IVC without wall excision were not included in this study. The literature search identified 13 studies, including 111 cases. Operative mortality in the reported cases was 8.1% (9 out of 111 cases). Thrombus in the artificial vascular graft was observed in two cases, and patency of the graft during the follow-up period was confirmed in 109 of the 111 cases (98.2%). These results suggested that the surgical outcomes of liver resection combined with IVC resection and reconstruction using the artificial vascular graft were favorable.	2018
29798843	A novel de novo CDH1 germline variant aids in the classification of carboxy-terminal E-cadherin alterations predicted to escape nonsense-mediated mRNA decay.	Most truncating cadherin 1 (CDH1) pathogenic alterations confer an elevated lifetime risk of diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) and lobular breast cancer (LBC). However, transcripts containing carboxy-terminal premature stop codons have been demonstrated to escape the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, and gastric and breast cancer risks associated with these truncations should be carefully evaluated. A female patient underwent multigene panel testing because of a personal history of invasive LBC diagnosed at age 54, which identified the germline CDH1 nonsense alteration, c.2506G>T (p.Glu836*), in the last exon of the gene. Subsequent parental testing for the alteration was negative and additional short tandem repeat analysis confirmed the familial relationships and the de novo occurrence in the proband. Based on the de novo occurrence, clinical history, and rarity in general population databases, this alteration was classified as a likely pathogenic variant. This is the most carboxy-terminal pathogenic alteration reported to date. Additionally, this alteration contributed to the classification of six other upstream CDH1 carboxy-terminal truncating variants as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Identifying the most distal pathogenic alteration provides evidence to classify other carboxy-terminal truncating variants as either pathogenic or benign, a fundamental step to offering presymptomatic screening and prophylactic procedures to the appropriate patients.	2018
29766696	Dietary practices and nutritional status in survivors of breast cancer	Wrong dietary practices and excessive body mass may not only influence the risk of primary breast cancer but also the risk of its recurrence.	Evaluation of dietary practices and identification of nutritional factors which may influence the risk of tumor recurrence in women with prior breast cancer.	The case-control study involved 108 women aged 50 years and older with history of breast cancer who were divided into two categories: women after completed cancer treatment with no recurrence for minimum 5 years (group I, n=82) and women with diagnosed breast cancer recurrence (group II, n=26). A control group (n=74) constituted of subjects with no breast cancer diagnosis. In every subject anthropometric measurements were taken and dietary practices were evaluated by means of an original questionnaire.	Average BMI and hip circumference values were higher in the group II than in the group I. In both study groups the percentage of high WHR values was significantly higher than in the control group. Women with history of cancer consumed significantly fewer vegetable and fruit and more refined cereals, dairy products, meat and cold cuts than women in the control group. Group I responders more often declared implementation and maintenance of changes in their diet after diagnosis of cancer than women from group II. Subjects with cancer history consumed more alcohol and more often used supplements than females in the control group.	Avoiding overweight and obesity along with following the principles of a healthy diet seems to reduce the risk of both breast cancer incidence and its recurrence.
29736741	Homologous recombination deficiency and host anti-tumor immunity in triple-negative breast cancer.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is associated with worse outcomes relative to other breast cancer subtypes. Chemotherapy remains the standard-of-care systemic therapy for patients with localized or metastatic disease, with few biomarkers to guide benefit.	We will discuss recent advances in our understanding of two key biological processes in TNBC, homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair deficiency and host anti-tumor immunity, and their intersection.	Recent advances in our understanding of homologous recombination (HR) deficiency, including FDA approval of PARP inhibitor olaparib for BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers, and host anti-tumor immunity in TNBC offer potential for new and biomarker-driven approaches to treat TNBC. Assays interrogating HR DNA repair capacity may guide treatment with agents inducing or targeting DNA damage repair. Tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are associated with improved prognosis in TNBC and recent efforts to characterize infiltrating immune cell subsets and activate host anti-tumor immunity offer promise, yet challenges remain particularly in tumors lacking pre-existing immune infiltrates. Advances in these fields provide potential biomarkers to stratify patients with TNBC and guide therapy: induction of DNA damage in HR-deficient tumors and activation of existing or recruitment of host anti-tumor immune cells. Importantly, these advances provide an opportunity to guide use of existing therapies and development of novel therapies for TNBC. Efforts to combine therapies that exploit HR deficiency to enhance the activity of immune-directed therapies offer promise.	HR deficiency remains an important biomarker target and potentially effective adjunct to enhance immunogenicity of 'immune cold' TNBCs.	2018
29722920	Prognostic relevance and performance characteristics of serum IGFBP-2 and PAPP-A in women with breast cancer: a long-term Danish cohort study.	Measurement of circulating insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), in particular IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-2, at the time of diagnosis, is independently prognostic in many cancers, but its clinical performance against other routinely determined prognosticators has not been examined. We measured IGF-I, IGF-II, pro-IGF-II, IGF bioactivity, IGFBP-2, -3, and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), an IGFBP regulator, in baseline samples of 301 women with breast cancer treated on four protocols (Odense, Denmark: 1993-1998). We evaluated performance characteristics (expressed as area under the curve, AUC) using Cox regression models to derive hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 10-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS), and compared those against the clinically used Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI). We measured the same biomarkers in 531 noncancer individuals to assess multidimensional relationships (MDR), and evaluated additional prognostic models using survival artificial neural network (SANN) and survival support vector machines (SSVM), as these enhance capture of MDRs. For RFS, increasing concentrations of circulating IGFBP-2 and PAPP-A were independently prognostic [HRbiomarker doubling : 1.474 (95% CIs: 1.160, 1.875, P = 0.002) and 1.952 (95% CIs: 1.364, 2.792, P < 0.001), respectively]. The AUCRFS for NPI was 0.626 (Cox model), improving to 0.694 (P = 0.012) with the addition of IGFBP-2 plus PAPP-A. Derived AUCRFS using SANN and SSVM did not perform superiorly. Similar patterns were observed for OS. These findings illustrate an important principle in biomarker qualification-measured circulating biomarkers may demonstrate independent prognostication, but this does not necessarily translate into substantial improvement in clinical performance.	2018
29697281	Enrichment of methylated molecules using enhanced-ice-co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR (E-ice-COLD-PCR) for the sensitive detection of disease-related hypermethylation.	The detection of specific DNA methylation patterns bears great promise as biomarker for personalized management of cancer patients. Co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR (COLD-PCR) assays are sensitive methods, but have previously only been able to analyze loss of DNA methylation.	Enhanced (E)-ice-COLD-PCR reactions starting from 2 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA were developed to analyze methylation patterns in two promoters with locked nucleic acid (LNA) probes blocking amplification of unmethylated CpGs. The enrichment of methylated molecules was compared to quantitative (q)PCR and quantified using serial dilutions.	E-ice-COLD-PCR allowed the multiplexed enrichment and quantification of methylated DNA. Assays were validated in primary breast cancer specimens and circulating cell-free DNA from cancer patients.	E-ice-COLD-PCR could prove a useful tool in the context of DNA methylation analysis for personalized medicine.	2018
29686033	Homologous Recombination and Replication Fork Protection: BRCA2 and More!	BRCA2 is a breast and ovarian tumor suppressor that guards against genome instability, a hallmark of cancer. Significant progress has been made in improving our understanding of BRCA2 function from biochemical, cellular, and mouse studies. The knowledge gained has been actively exploited to develop therapeutic strategies, including PARP inhibition, which has shown promising clinical outcomes. Recently, tremendous excitement has been generated by the findings of the roles of BRCA2 and other proteins in suppressing replication stress through homologous recombination and in the protection of stalled replication forks. Processes such as mitotic DNA synthesis and fork reversal have taken center stage in these studies. Here, we discuss our recent findings in the context of these advances.	2017
29681015	Cold therapy to prevent paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.	This case-control study was designed to assess the efficacy of cryotherapy to prevent paclitaxel-induced painful peripheral neuropathy in women with breast cancer.	Participants served as their own paired control, with randomization of the cooled glove/sock to either the dominant or the non-dominant hand/foot, worn for 15 min prior to, during, and 15 min after completion of the paclitaxel infusion. Outcome measures included the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, the Brief Pain Inventory, and quantitative sensory testing. Data were measured at each of six time points-baseline, post-treatment (approximately 2 weeks after the last paclitaxel infusion), and at the first, fifth, ninth, and final weekly paclitaxel treatments.	Of 29 randomized participants, 20 (69%) received at least one cryotherapy treatment, and 11 (38%) received all four cryotherapy treatments. Ten (34%) participants could not tolerate the cryotherapy, and six (21%) declined further participation at some point during the trial. Only seven participants (24%) were available for the final post-chemotherapy QST and questionnaires. There were no significant differences in measures of neuropathy or pain between treated and untreated hands or feet.	Strategies to prevent painful peripheral neuropathy are urgently needed. In this current trial, dropout due to discomfort precluded adequate power to fully understand the potential benefits of cryotherapy. Much more research is needed to discover safe and effective preventive strategies that can be easily implemented within busy infusion centers.	2018
29665588	Current Technique and Application of Percutaneous Cryotherapy.	Local ablative therapies have become an established treatment option in interventional oncology. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are a standard of care in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, there is an increasing interest in cryotherapy, one of the oldest ablation techniques. It has some unique characteristics with regard to technology and mechanism of action.	A systematic literature search using the terms cryotherapy, cryosurgery and cryoablation was performed. Selected studies are presented dealing with the mechanism of action, cryobiology and clinical use of percutaneous, image-guided cryoablation. Recent developments and perspectives are presented.	Cryotherapy is increasingly used and has been included in guidelines for selected tumor entities such as renal cell carcinoma. Cryo-immunotherapy and combination treatments are future areas of interest.	Cryoabalation may be used in many indications. Its major advantages are its unique visualization and the anesthesiologic effects of cold. While there are only a few prospectively randomized trials, the existing data on the use of cryoablation is promising. Its use appears to be justified in selected tumors, oligometastatic patients and for palliative indications.	· Interventionalists need to know about the unique characteristics and advantages of cryoablation.. · Proper patient selection and optimal image guidance are essential for successful cryotherapy.. · Cryoablation offers unique advantages such as anesthesiologic effects and characteristic imaging features.. · The lack of prospective randomized trials is a key disadvantage of cryoablation..	· Mahnken AH, König AM, Figiel JH.

29661737	A rapid triage protocol to optimize cold ischemic time for breast resection specimens.	Prolonged time from specimen excision to adequate formalin exposure, or cold ischemic time (CIT), negatively impacts estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER-2 biomarker studies routinely performed on breast specimens. Current guidelines recommend CIT of ≤1 h. Since formalin penetrates resections slowly, optimal fixation requires incision. We evaluated the efficacy of a rapid triage protocol developed to optimize CIT. We identified 2821 specimens: 650 (23.0%) excisional biopsies (EB), 1051 (37.3%) lumpectomies, and 1120 (39.7%) mastectomies. CIT was available for 2362 (83.7%), with 1845 (78.1%) ≤1 h and 2323 (98.3%) ≤4 h. IHC was performed in 533/2821 (18.9%) and was associated with lumpectomy and mastectomy procedures when compared to EB. However, IHC was also performed on 11.1% (72/650) of EB specimens despite EB being significantly less likely to have CIT recorded (468/650; 72% for EB vs. 1894/2171; 87.2% for lumpectomies/mastectomies). Our study highlights the need for rapid triage of breast resections with known or suspected malignant diagnoses and outlines our procedure for optimizing CIT. Additionally, we advocate treating ALL breast resections as having the potential of being malignant and requiring biomarker studies for which optimal CIT is of great importance.	2018
29610388	Clinically actionable mutation profiles in patients with cancer identified by whole-genome sequencing.	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) efforts have established catalogs of mutations relevant to cancer development. However, the clinical utility of this information remains largely unexplored. Here, we present the results of the first eight patients recruited into a clinical whole-genome sequencing (WGS) program in the United Kingdom. We performed PCR-free WGS of fresh frozen tumors and germline DNA at 75× and 30×, respectively, using the HiSeq2500 HTv4. Subtracted tumor VCFs and paired germlines were subjected to comprehensive analysis of coding and noncoding regions, integration of germline with somatically acquired variants, and global mutation signatures and pathway analyses. Results were classified into tiers and presented to a multidisciplinary tumor board. WGS results helped to clarify an uncertain histopathological diagnosis in one case, led to informed or supported prognosis in two cases, leading to de-escalation of therapy in one, and indicated potential treatments in all eight. Overall 26 different tier 1 potentially clinically actionable findings were identified using WGS compared with six SNVs/indels using routine targeted NGS. These initial results demonstrate the potential of WGS to inform future diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment choice in cancer and justify the systematic evaluation of the clinical utility of WGS in larger cohorts of patients with cancer.	2018
29565204	ZnO Q-dots as a potent therapeutic nanomedicine for in vitro cytotoxicity evaluation of mouth KB44, breast MCF7, colon HT29 and HeLa cancer cell lines, mouse ear swelling tests in vivo and its side effects using the animal model.	Nanoformulations derived from fine porous ZnO quantum dot nanoparticles (QD NPs) can offer strong potential medical applications; especially in cancer therapy. ZnO QD NPs was synthesized by sol-gel hydrothermal process, fast cold quenching and further smart surface functionalization methods to obtain ultrasmall size (1-4 nm) NPs. ZnO nanopolymer, a wetting agent, PEG co-solvent and water/oil emulsion stabilizer were considered in our nanofluid formulation. The resulting nanofluid was characterized by SEM, FTIR, photoluminescence, band gap energy, zeta potential and UV-Vis spectroscopy. The cytotoxic effects on the growth of four cancer cell lines were evaluated by MTT assay. The IC50 (µg/ml) values of 30, 41, 40 and 35 for KB44, MCF-7, HT29 and HeLa cells, respectively, after 48 h of nanoformulation treatment suggested the cytotoxic effect of this nanoformulation on these cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner (p < .05). ZnO nanofluid destroyed cancer cell lines more efficiently than the normal HFF-2 (IC50 = 105 µg/ml). The reduction in cell viability in response to ZnO nanofluid treatment induced apoptosis in the cultured cells. Skin sensitization test plus antibacterial activity were also measured. Side effect tests on 70 white mice in vivo resulted in only 3-4 abnormal situations in hepatic tissue section possibly due to the idiosyncratic drug reactions.	2018
29531247	High-sensitivity assay for monitoring ESR1 mutations in circulating cell-free DNA of breast cancer patients receiving endocrine therapy.	Approximately 70% of breast cancers (BCs) express estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and are treated with endocrine therapy. However, the effectiveness of this therapy is limited by innate or acquired resistance in approximately one-third of patients. Activating mutations in the ESR1 gene that encodes ERα promote critical resistance mechanisms. Here, we developed a high sensitivity approach based on enhanced-ice-COLD-PCR for detecting ESR1 mutations. The method produced an enrichment up to 100-fold and allowed the unambiguous detection of ESR1 mutations even when they consisted of only 0.01% of the total ESR1 allelic fraction. After COLD-PCR enrichment, methods based on next-generation sequencing or droplet-digital PCR were employed to detect and quantify ESR1 mutations. We applied the method to detect ESR1 mutations in circulating free DNA from the plasma of 56 patients with metastatic ER-positive BC. Fifteen of these patients were found to have ESR1 mutations at codons 536-538. This study demonstrates the utility of the enhanced-ice-COLD-PCR approach for simplifying and improving the detection of ESR1 tumor mutations in liquid biopsies. Because of its high sensitivity, the approach may potentially be applicable to patients with non-metastatic disease.	2018
29507672	Association of miR-548c-5p, miR-7-5p, miR-210-3p, miR-128-3p with recurrence in systemically untreated breast cancer.	Current prognostic markers allocate the majority of lymph node (LN) negative and estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer patients into the high-risk group. Accordingly, most patients receive systemic treatments although approximately 40% of these patients may have been cured by surgery and radiotherapy alone. Two studies identified seven prognostic microRNAs in systemically untreated, LN negative and ER positive breast cancer patients which may allow more precise patient classification. However, six of the seven microRNAs were analyzed in both studies but only found to be prognostic in one study. To validate their prognostic potential, we analyzed microRNA expression in an independent cohort (n = 110) using a pair-matched study design minimizing dependence of classical markers. The expression of hsa-miR-548c-5p was significantly associated with abridged disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR]:1.96, p = 0.027). Contradicting published results, high hsa-miR-516-3p expression was associated with favorable outcome (HR:0.29, p = 0.0068). The association is probably time-dependent indicating later relapse. Additionally, re-analysis of previously published expression data of two matching cohorts (n = 100, n = 255) supports an association of hsa-miR-128-3p with shortened disease-free survival (HR:2.48, p = 0.0033) and an upregulation of miR-7-5p (p = 0.0038; p = 0.039) and miR-210-3p (p = 0.031) in primary tumors of patients who experienced metastases. Further analysis may verify the prognostic potential of these microRNAs.	2018
29472318	Fork Protection and Therapy Resistance in Hereditary Breast Cancer.	The BRCA-Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway preserves the genome and suppresses cancer and is a main determinant of chemotherapeutic efficacy. The hereditary breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 function in DNA double-strand break repair mediating distinct steps of homologous recombination (HR). More recently, independent of DNA repair, functions in the replication stress response have come to light, providing insight as to how the BRCA-FA pathway also balances genome preservation with proliferation. The BRCA-FA proteins associate with the replisome and contribute to the efficiency and recovery of replication following perturbations that slow or arrest DNA replication. Although the full repertoire of functions in the replication stress response remains to be elucidated, the function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in protecting stalled replication forks contributes along with HR to the sensitivity of BRCA-associated tumors to chemotherapy. Moreover, chemoresistance evolves from restoration of either HR and/or fork protection. Although mechanisms underlying the restoration of HR have been characterized, it remains less clear how restoration of fork protection is achieved. Here, we outline mechanisms of "rewired" fork protection and chemotherapy resistance in BRCA cancer. We propose that mechanisms are linked to permissive replication that limits fork remodeling and therefore opportunities for fork degradation. Combating this chemoresistance mechanism will require drugs that inactivate replication bypass mechanisms.	2017
29471352	Delay to Formalin Fixation (Cold Ischemia Time) Effect on Breast Cancer Molecules.	The gold standard of examining breast biomarkers, including estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/Ki-67, is to perform these assays on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. However, preanalytical variables may confound these assays. One of these factors is delay to formalin fixation (DFF). The purpose of this review is to evaluate each study that investigated the effect of DFF on breast biomarkers and other molecules.	Thirteen primary research articles were identified by the literature search. The credibility of the studies was judged based on the degree of controlling other confounding factors. Nine studies had a prospective design with a high number of controlled variables.	Most of the studies concluded that DFF had an effect on ER/PR/HER2. Some of these studies showed that DFF had negative effect on other markers used either clinically or for research purposes.	The vast majority of the studies agree that DFF has negative effect on breast biomarkers.	2018
29471114	Reference Size Matching, Whole-Genome Amplification, and Fluorescent Labeling as a Method for Chromosomal Microarray Analysis of Clinically Actionable Copy Number Alterations in Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded Tumor Tissue.	Cancer genome copy number alterations (CNAs) assist clinicians in selecting targeted therapeutics. Solid tumor CNAs are most commonly evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Although fluorescence in situ hybridization is a sensitive and specific assay for interrogating preselected genomic regions, it provides no information about coexisting clinically significant copy number changes. Chromosomal microarray analysis is an alternative DNA-based method for interrogating genome-wide CNAs in solid tumors. However, DNA extracted from FFPE tumor tissue produces an essential, yet problematic, sample type. The College of American Pathologists/American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines for optimal tumor tissue handling, published in 2007 for breast cancer and in 2016 for gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas, are lacking for other solid tumors. Thus, cold ischemia times are seldom monitored in non-breast cancer and non-gastroesophageal adenocarcinomas, and all tumor biospecimens are affected by chemical fixation. Although intended to preserve specimens for long-term storage, formalin fixation causes loss of genetic information through DNA damage. Herein, we describe a reference size matching, whole-genome amplification, and fluorescent labeling method for FFPE-derived DNA designed to improve chromosomal microarray results from suboptimal nucleic acids and salvage highly degraded samples. With this technological advance, whole-genome copy number analysis of tumor DNA can be reliably performed in the clinical laboratory for a wide variety of tissue conditions and tumor types.	2018
29470314	Genetic variation in P2RX7 and pain tolerance.	P2X7 is a nonselective cation channel activated by extracellular ATP. P2X7 activation contributes to the proinflammatory response to injury or bacterial invasion and mediates apoptosis. Recently, P2X7 function has been linked to chronic inflammatory and neuropathic pain. P2X7 may contribute to pain modulation both by effects on peripheral tissue injury underlying clinical pain states, and through alterations in central nervous system processing, as suggested by animal models. To further test its role in pain sensitivity, we examined whether variation within the P2RX7 gene, which encodes the P2X7 receptor, was associated with experimentally induced pain in human patients. Experimental pain was assessed in Tromsø 6, a longitudinal and cross-sectional population-based study (N = 3016), and the BrePainGen cohort, consisting of patients who underwent breast cancer surgery (N = 831). For both cohorts, experimental pain intensity and tolerance were assessed with the cold-pressor test. In addition, multisite chronic pain was assessed in Tromsø 6 and pain intensity 1 week after surgery was assessed in BrePainGen. We tested whether the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7958311, previously implicated in clinical pain, was associated with experimental and clinical pain phenotypes. In addition, we examined effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs208294 and rs208296, for which previous results have been equivocal. Rs7958311 was associated with experimental pain intensity in the meta-analysis of both cohorts. Significant associations were also found for multisite pain and postoperative pain. Our results strengthen the existing evidence and suggest that P2X7 and genetic variation in the P2RX7-gene may be involved in the modulation of human pain sensitivity.	2018
29449315	Metaplastic breast cancer in a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 and somatic loss of heterozygosity.	Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is rare and has a poor prognosis. Here we describe genetic analysis of a 41-yr-old female patient with MBC and neurofibromatosis type I (NF1). She initially presented with pT3N1a, grade 3 MBC, but lung metastases were discovered subsequently. To identify the molecular cause of her NF1, we screened for germline mutations disrupting NF1 or SPRED1, revealing a heterozygous germline single-nucleotide variant (SNV) in exon 21 of NF1 at c.2709G>A, Chr 17: 29556342. By report, this variant disrupts pre-mRNA splicing of NF1 transcripts. No pathogenic mutations were identified in SPRED1 A potential association between MBC and NF1 was reported in eight previous cases, but none underwent detailed genomics analysis. To identify additional candidate germline variants potentially predisposing to MBC, we conducted targeted exome sequencing of 279 established cancer-causing genes in a control blood sample, disclosing four rare SNVs. Analysis of her breast tumor showed markedly altered variant allelic fractions (VAFs) for two (50%) of them, revealing somatic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at germline SNVs. Of these, only the VAF of the pathogenic SNV in NF1 was increased in the tumor. Tumor sequencing demonstrated five somatic mutations altering TP53, BRCA1, and other genes potentially contributing to cancer formation. Because somatic LOH at certain germline SNVs can enhance their impacts, we conclude that increased allelic imbalance of the pathogenic SNV in NF1 likely contributed to tumorigenesis. Our results highlight a need to assess predisposing genetic factors and LOH that can cause rare, aggressive diseases such as MBC in NF1.	2018
29417930	MELK expression correlates with tumor mitotic activity but is not required for cancer growth.	The Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase (MELK) has been identified as a promising therapeutic target in multiple cancer types. MELK over-expression is associated with aggressive disease, and MELK has been implicated in numerous cancer-related processes, including chemotherapy resistance, stem cell renewal, and tumor growth. Previously, we established that triple-negative breast cancer cell lines harboring CRISPR/Cas9-induced null mutations in MELK proliferate at wild-type levels in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we generate several additional knockout clones of MELK and demonstrate that across cancer types, cells lacking MELK exhibit wild-type growth in vitro, under environmental stress, in the presence of cytotoxic chemotherapies, and in vivo. By combining our MELK-knockout clones with a recently described, highly specific MELK inhibitor, we further demonstrate that the acute inhibition of MELK results in no specific anti-proliferative phenotype. Analysis of gene expression data from cohorts of cancer patients identifies MELK expression as a correlate of tumor mitotic activity, explaining its association with poor clinical prognosis. In total, our results demonstrate the power of CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic approaches to investigate cancer drug targets, and call into question the rationale for treating patients with anti-MELK monotherapies.	2018
29414946	Asparagine bioavailability governs metastasis in a model of breast cancer.	Using a functional model of breast cancer heterogeneity, we previously showed that clonal sub-populations proficient at generating circulating tumour cells were not all equally capable of forming metastases at secondary sites. A combination of differential expression and focused in vitro and in vivo RNA interference screens revealed candidate drivers of metastasis that discriminated metastatic clones. Among these, asparagine synthetase expression in a patient's primary tumour was most strongly correlated with later metastatic relapse. Here we show that asparagine bioavailability strongly influences metastatic potential. Limiting asparagine by knockdown of asparagine synthetase, treatment with l-asparaginase, or dietary asparagine restriction reduces metastasis without affecting growth of the primary tumour, whereas increased dietary asparagine or enforced asparagine synthetase expression promotes metastatic progression. Altering asparagine availability in vitro strongly influences invasive potential, which is correlated with an effect on proteins that promote the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. This provides at least one potential mechanism for how the bioavailability of a single amino acid could regulate metastatic progression.	2018
29396409	Sensitive detection of mitochondrial DNA variants for analysis of mitochondrial DNA-enriched extracts from frozen tumor tissue.	Large variation exists in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) not only between but also within individuals. Also in human cancer, tumor-specific mtDNA variation exists. In this work, we describe the comparison of four methods to extract mtDNA as pure as possible from frozen tumor tissue. Also, three state-of-the-art methods for sensitive detection of mtDNA variants were evaluated. The main aim was to develop a procedure to detect low-frequent single-nucleotide mtDNA-specific variants in frozen tumor tissue. We show that of the methods evaluated, DNA extracted from cytosol fractions following exonuclease treatment results in highest mtDNA yield and purity from frozen tumor tissue (270-fold mtDNA enrichment). Next, we demonstrate the sensitivity of detection of low-frequent single-nucleotide mtDNA variants (≤1% allele frequency) in breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 by single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing, UltraSEEK chemistry based mass spectrometry, and digital PCR. We also show de novo detection and allelic phasing of variants by SMRT sequencing. We conclude that our sensitive procedure to detect low-frequent single-nucleotide mtDNA variants from frozen tumor tissue is based on extraction of DNA from cytosol fractions followed by exonuclease treatment to obtain high mtDNA purity, and subsequent SMRT sequencing for (de novo) detection and allelic phasing of variants.	2018
29372396	Symptom management: the utility of regional cooling for hand-foot syndrome induced by pegylated liposomal doxorubicin in ovarian cancer.	Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a major side effect of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD). Regional cooling during PLD infusion was shown to improve severe HFS. We investigated the utility of frozen gloves and socks (FGS) as a simpler cooling method.	To evaluate the utility and safety of regional cooling with FGS for PLD-induced HFS, we retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced ovarian cancer who used FGS during PLD-containing regimens.	Ninety-six patients were analyzed. The incidence of HFS was 51% (≥ grade 2, 32%) in the PLD group and 38% (≥ grade 2, 6%) in the PLD + CBDCA group. The respective percentages of patients who underwent PLD dose modification/discontinuation were 41%/75% in the PLD group and 9%/30% in the PLD + CBDCA group. The reasons for discontinuation of PLD and PLD + CBDCA therapy were progressive disease, HFS, allergy, oral mucositis, and others. HFS was the only reason for PLD dose modification in both the PLD and PLD + CBDCA groups. The completion rate of FGS was 96%, with discontinuation in three cases due to pain from cooling.	Our study indicates that FGS is a safe, simple method with good tolerability. A prospective study is needed for further assessment.	2018
29243164	Effects of exercise during chemotherapy on chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy: a multicenter, randomized controlled trial.	Over half of all cancer patients receiving taxane-, platinum-, or vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapy experience chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), which includes numbness, tingling, pain, cold sensitivity, and motor impairment in the hands and feet. CIPN is a dose-limiting toxicity, potentially increasing mortality. There are no FDA-approved drugs to treat CIPN, and behavioral interventions such as exercise are promising yet understudied. This secondary analysis of our nationwide phase III randomized controlled trial of exercise for fatigue examines (1) effects of exercise on CIPN symptoms, (2) factors that predict CIPN symptoms, and (3) factors that moderate effects of exercise on CIPN symptoms.	Cancer patients (N = 355, 56 ± 11 years, 93% female, 79% breast cancer) receiving taxane-, platinum-, or vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapy were randomized to chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus Exercise for Cancer Patients (EXCAP©®). EXCAP is a standardized, individualized, moderate-intensity, home-based, six-week progressive walking and resistance exercise program. Patients reported CIPN symptoms of numbness and tingling and hot/coldness in hands/feet (0-10 scales) pre- and post-intervention. We explored baseline neuropathy, sex, age, body mass index, cancer stage, and cancer type as possible factors associated with CIPN symptoms and exercise effectiveness.	Exercise reduced CIPN symptoms of hot/coldness in hands/feet (-0.46 units, p = 0.045) and numbness and tingling (- 0.42 units, p = 0.061) compared to the control. Exercise reduced CIPN symptoms more for patients who were older (p = 0.086), male (p = 0.028), or had breast cancer (p = 0.076).	Exercise appears to reduce CIPN symptoms in patients receiving taxane-, platinum-, or vinca alkaloid-based chemotherapy. Clinicians should consider prescribing exercise for these patients.

29234367	The Use of Herbal Remedies among Mothers of Young Children Living in the Central Appalachian Region.	Women often use herbal remedies as a complement or alternative to traditional medicine. Guided by the Comprehensive Model of Information Seeking, this study examined use of herbal remedies among mothers of young children living in the Central Appalachian Region.	A cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers of young children (n = 178). The outcome measure of interest was the use of any herbal remedy in the past six months. Two scales were developed to measure information seeking channels and to measure beliefs about the safety/efficacy of herbal remedies.	One-third reported using herbal remedies in the past six months, with fenugreek being the most common. Most reported using herbal remedies to increase breast milk production and to relieve cold/flu-like symptoms. Women scoring highest in information seeking channels were three times as likely to use herbal remedies. Women scoring highest in the beliefs about the safety/efficacy of herbal remedies were four times as likely to use herbal remedies.	Herbal remedies are commonly used among women living in the Central Appalachian Region, a region with lower education and income level. Therefore, public health interventions about the types, safety, and efficacy of herbal remedies may improve health within this population.	2017
29220501	Combination of 247 Genome-Wide Association Studies Reveals High Cancer Risk as a Result of Evolutionary Adaptation.	Analysis of GLOBOCAN-2012 data shows clearly here that cancer incidence worldwide is highly related with low average annual temperatures and extreme low temperatures. This applies for all cancers together or separately for many frequent or rare cancer types (all cancers P = 9.49×10-18). Supporting fact is that Inuit people, living at extreme low temperatures, have the highest cancer rates today. Hypothesizing an evolutionary explanation, 240 cancer genome-wide association studies, and seven genome-wide association studies for cold and high-altitude adaptation were combined. A list of 1,377 cancer-associated genes was created to initially investigate whether cold selected genes are enriched with cancer-associated genes. Among Native Americans, Inuit and Eskimos, the highest association was observed for Native Americans (P = 6.7×10-5). An overall or a meta-analysis approach confirmed further this result. Similar approach for three populations living at extreme high altitude, revealed high association for Andeans-Tibetans (P = 1.3×10-11). Overall analysis or a meta-analysis was also significant. A separate analysis showed special selection for tumor suppressor genes. These results can be viewed along with those of previous functional studies that showed that reduced apoptosis potential due to specific p53 variants (the most important tumor suppressor gene) is beneficial in high-altitude and cold environments. In conclusion, this study shows that genetic variants selected for adaptation at extreme environmental conditions can increase cancer risk later on age. This is in accordance with antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis.	2018
29212833	Personalized cancer therapy-leveraging a knowledge base for clinical decision-making.	Next-generation sequencing (NGS), also known as massively parallel sequencing, is rapidly being incorporated into oncology practice. Interpretation of genomic reports and selecting treatments based on the tumor's genomic analysis becomes more and more complicated for the treating oncologist because of the use of larger panels covering dozens to hundreds of genes and the amount of rapidly emerging clinical/translational data. To help guide personalized treatments in oncology, The Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy (IPCT) at MD Anderson Cancer Center has developed a knowledge base, available at https://personalizedcancertherapy.org or https://pct.mdanderson.org (PCT). This knowledge base provides information on the function of common genomic alterations and their therapeutic implications. Here, we describe how such genomic information can be used by health-care providers to identify genomically matched therapies.	2018
29206917	Tunicamycin-induced ER stress in breast cancer cells neither expresses GRP78 on the surface nor secretes it into the media.	GRP78 (an Mr 78 kDa calcium dependent glucose binding protein) is located in ER lumen. It functions as ER chaperone and translocates proteins for glycosylation at the asparagine residue present in the sequon Asn-X-Ser/Thr. Paraffin sections from N-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin treated ER-/PR-/HER2+ (double negative) breast tumor in athymic nude mice exhibited reduced N-glycan but increased GRP78 expression. We have evaluated the effect of tunicamycin on cellular localization of GRP78 in metastatic human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 (ER-/PR-/HER2-). Tunicamycin inhibited cell proliferation in a time and dose-dependent manner. Nonmetastatic estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF-7 breast cancer cells were also equally effective. GRP78 expression (protein and mRNA) was higher in tunicamycin (1.0 μg/mL) treated MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. GRP78 is an ER stress marker, so we have followed its intracellular localization using immunofluorescence microscopy after subjecting the cancer cells to various stress conditions. Unfixed cells stained with either FITC-conjugated Concanavalin A (Con A) or Texas-red conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) exhibited surface expression of N-glycans but not GRP78. GRP78 became detectable only after a brief exposure of cells to ice-cold methanol. Western blotting did not detect GRP78 in conditioned media of cancer cells whereas it did for MMP-1. The conclusion, GRP78 is expressed neither on the outer-leaflet of the (ER-/PR-/HER2-) human breast cancer cells nor it is secreted into the culture media during tunicamycin-induced ER stress. Our study therefore suggests strongly that anti-tumorigenic action of tunicamycin can be modeled to develop next generation cancer therapy, i.e., glycotherapy for treating breast and other sold tumors.	2018
29164157	Inflammatory Breast Cancer and Warm Antibody Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: A Rare Paraneoplastic Syndrome.	Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a disease process that involves the destruction of red blood cells mediated by the humoral immune system. It can be characterized as a cold agglutinin syndrome, paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria, and warm, mixed type, and drug-induced AIHA. Although a well-established relationship exists between the presence of AIHA and lymphoproliferative malignancy, AIHA rarely presents in association with solid malignancies. An analysis of the limited number of published cases of AIHA in association with solid malignancies performed showed that AIHA may present before the diagnosis of a solid malignancy, concurrently with the presence of a solid malignancy, or even on resolution of a solid malignancy. Few cases of solid cancers associated with AIHA have been reported. AIHA rarely presents as a paraneoplastic syndrome indicating existence of a solid cancer. We report a case of inflammatory breast cancer with AIHA.
29146401	Neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer (ExteNET): 5-year analysis of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.	ExteNET showed that 1 year of neratinib, an irreversible pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly improves 2-year invasive disease-free survival after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in women with HER2-positive breast cancer. We report updated efficacy outcomes from a protocol-defined 5-year follow-up sensitivity analysis and long-term toxicity findings.	In this ongoing randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, eligible women aged 18 years or older (≥20 years in Japan) with stage 1-3c (modified to stage 2-3c in February, 2010) operable breast cancer, who had completed neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab with no evidence of disease recurrence or metastatic disease at study entry. Patients who were eligible patients were randomly assigned (1:1) via permuted blocks stratified according to hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive vs hormone receptor-negative), nodal status (0 vs 1-3 vs or ≥4 positive nodes), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (given sequentially vs concurrently with chemotherapy), then implemented centrally via an interactive voice and web-response system, to receive 1 year of oral neratinib 240 mg/day or matching placebo. Treatment was given continuously for 1 year, unless disease recurrence or new breast cancer, intolerable adverse events, or consent withdrawal occurred. Patients, investigators, and trial funder were masked to treatment allocation. The predefined endpoint of the 5-year analysis was invasive disease-free survival, analysed by intention to treat. ExteNET is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00878709, and is closed to new participants.	Between July 9, 2009, and Oct 24, 2011, 2840 eligible women with early HER2-positive breast cancer were recruited from community-based and academic institutions in 40 countries and randomly assigned to receive neratinib (n=1420) or placebo (n=1420). After a median follow-up of 5·2 years (IQR 2·1-5·3), patients in the neratinib group had significantly fewer invasive disease-free survival events than those in the placebo group (116 vs 163 events; stratified hazard ratio 0·73, 95% CI 0·57-0·92, p=0·0083). The 5-year invasive disease-free survival was 90·2% (95% CI 88·3-91·8) in the neratinib group and 87·7% (85·7-89·4) in the placebo group. Without diarrhoea prophylaxis, the most common grade 3-4 adverse events in the neratinib group, compared with the placebo group, were diarrhoea (561 [40%] grade 3 and one [<1%] grade 4 with neratinib vs 23 [2%] grade 3 with placebo), vomiting (grade 3: 47 [3%] vs five [<1%]), and nausea (grade 3: 26 [2%] vs two [<1%]). Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred in 103 (7%) women in the neratinib group and 85 (6%) women in the placebo group. No evidence of increased risk of long-term toxicity or long-term adverse consequences of neratinib-associated diarrhoea were identified with neratinib compared with placebo.	At the 5-year follow-up, 1 year of extended adjuvant therapy with neratinib, administered after chemotherapy and trastuzumab, significantly reduced the proportion of clinically relevant breast cancer relapses-ie, those that might lead to death, such as distant and locoregional relapses outside the preserved breast-without increasing the risk of long-term toxicity. An analysis of overall survival is planned after 248 events.	Wyeth, Pfizer, and Puma Biotechnology.	2017
29125079	[Relapse of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy following treatment with zoledronic acid].	Zoledronic acid is a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate that is frequently used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Many patients experience a so-called acute-phase reaction during initial treatment; this is characterized by flu-like symptoms and fever.	We describe a 61-year-old woman who suffered from chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), and who was started on intravenous zoledronic acid treatment as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Within 24 hours of the initial treatment she developed cold shivers, extreme fatigue, muscle pain and headache. These symptoms resolved spontaneously in the course of the following days. At the same time, she also experienced a CIDP relapse, with a tingling sensation in her arms and legs and deterioration in her ability to walk. Considering the course of the symptoms and the absence of any other cause, CIDP relapse was very probably the result of the acute-phase reaction induced by zoledronic acid.	Caution is warranted when using nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as zoledronic acid, particularly in patients with known neuromuscular disorders.	2017
29121286	Prediction of persistent post-surgery pain by preoperative cold pain sensitivity: biomarker development with machine-learning-derived analysis.	To prevent persistent post-surgery pain, early identification of patients at high risk is a clinical need. Supervised machine-learning techniques were used to test how accurately the patients' performance in a preoperatively performed tonic cold pain test could predict persistent post-surgery pain.	We analysed 763 patients from a cohort of 900 women who were treated for breast cancer, of whom 61 patients had developed signs of persistent pain during three yr of follow-up. Preoperatively, all patients underwent a cold pain test (immersion of the hand into a water bath at 2-4 °C). The patients rated the pain intensity using a numerical ratings scale (NRS) from 0 to 10. Supervised machine-learning techniques were used to construct a classifier that could predict patients at risk of persistent pain.	Whether or not a patient rated the pain intensity at NRS=10 within less than 45 s during the cold water immersion test provided a negative predictive value of 94.4% to assign a patient to the "persistent pain" group. If NRS=10 was never reached during the cold test, the predictive value for not developing persistent pain was almost 97%. However, a low negative predictive value of 10% implied a high false positive rate.	Results provide a robust exclusion of persistent pain in women with an accuracy of 94.4%. Moreover, results provide further support for the hypothesis that the endogenous pain inhibitory system may play an important role in the process of pain becoming persistent.	2017
29101110	The Biology of Bone Metastasis.	Bone metastasis, or the development of secondary tumors within the bone of cancer patients, is a debilitating and incurable disease. Despite its morbidity, the biology of bone metastasis represents one of the most complex and intriguing of all oncogenic processes. This complexity derives from the intricately organized bone microenvironment in which the various stages of hematopoiesis, osteogenesis, and osteolysis are jointly regulated but spatially restricted. Disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) from various common malignancies such as breast, prostate, lung, and kidney cancers or myeloma are uniquely primed to subvert these endogenous bone stromal elements to grow into pathological osteolytic or osteoblastic lesions. This colonization process can be separated into three key steps: seeding, dormancy, and outgrowth. Targeting the processes of dormancy and initial outgrowth offers the most therapeutic promise. Here, we discuss the concepts of the bone metastasis niche, from controlling tumor-cell survival to growth into clinically detectable disease.	2018
29066500	Suppression of protein tyrosine phosphatase N23 predisposes to breast tumorigenesis via activation of FYN kinase.	Disruption of the balanced modulation of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation has been implicated in the etiology of various human cancers, including breast cancer. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase N23 (PTPN23) resides in chromosomal region 3p21.3, which is hemizygously or homozygously lost in some breast cancer patients. In a loss-of-function PTPome screen, our laboratory identified PTPN23 as a suppressor of cell motility and invasion in mammary epithelial and breast cancer cells. Now, our TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database analyses illustrate a correlation between low PTPN23 expression and poor survival in breast cancers of various subtypes. Therefore, we investigated the tumor-suppressive function of PTPN23 in an orthotopic transplantation mouse model. Suppression of PTPN23 in Comma 1Dβ cells induced breast tumors within 56 wk. In PTPN23-depleted tumors, we detected hyperphosphorylation of the autophosphorylation site tyrosine in the SRC family kinase (SFK) FYN as well as Tyr142 in β-catenin. We validated the underlying mechanism of PTPN23 function in breast tumorigenesis as that of a key phosphatase that normally suppresses the activity of FYN in two different models. We demonstrated that tumor outgrowth from PTPN23-deficient BT474 cells was suppressed in a xenograft model in vivo upon treatment with AZD0530, an SFK inhibitor. Furthermore, double knockout of FYN and PTPN23 via CRISPR/CAS9 also attenuated tumor outgrowth from PTPN23 knockout Cal51 cells. Overall, this mechanistic analysis of the tumor-suppressive function of PTPN23 in breast cancer supports the identification of FYN as a therapeutic target for breast tumors with heterozygous or homozygous loss of PTPN23.	2017
29061050	Temperature/pH/Enzyme Triple-Responsive Cationic Protein/PAA-b-PNIPAAm Nanogels for Controlled Anticancer Drug and Photosensitizer Delivery against Multidrug Resistant Breast Cancer Cells.	The tumor microenvironments are often acidic and overexpress specific enzymes. In this work, we synthesized a poly(AA-b-NIPAAm) copolymer (PAA-b-PNIPAAm) using a reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization method. PAA-b-PNIPAAm and a cationic protein (protamine) were self-assembled into nanogels, which effectively reduced the cytotoxicity of protamine. The protamine/PAA-b-PNIPAAm nanogels were responsive to the stimuli including temperature, pH, and enzyme due to disaggregation of PAA-b-PNIPAAm, change in random coil/α-helix conformation of protamine, and enzymatic hydrolysis of the protein. Changing the pH from 7.4 to a lowered pHe (6.5-5.0) resulted in an increase in mean particle size and smartly converted surface charge from negative to positive. The cationic nanogels easily passed through the cell membrane and enhanced intracellular localization and accumulation of doxorubicin-loaded nanogels in multidrug resistant MCF-7/ADR breast cancer cells. Cold shock treatment triggered rapid intracellular release of doxorubicin against P-glycoprotein (Pgp)-mediated drug efflux, showing significantly improved anticancer efficacy as compared with free DOX. Furthermore, the nanogels were able to carry a rose bengal photosensitizer and caused significant damage to the multidrug resistant cancer cells under irradiation. The cationic nanogels with stimuli-responsive properties show promise as drug carrier for chemotherapy and photodynamic therapy against cancers.	2017

29022494	Colder environments are associated with a greater cancer incidence in the female population of the United States.	Cancer incidence and/or mortality among individuals varies with diet, socio-culture, ethnicity, race, gender, and age. Similarly, environmental temperature modulates many biological functions. To study the effect of environment temperature on cancer incidence, the US population was selected. Because, county-wise cancer incidence rate data of various anatomical site-specific cancers and different races/ethnicities for both males and females are available. Moreover, the differences amongst the aforementioned factors among individuals are much less, as compared to the world population. Statistical analysis showed a negative correlation between the average annual temperature and cancer incidence rate at all anatomical sites and individually for 13 types (out of 16 types) of anatomical site-specific cancer incidence rates (e.g. uterine, bladder, thyroid, breast, esophagus, ovary, melanoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, brain, pancreas, etc.) for females. Further analysis found a similar inverse trend in all races/ethnicities of the female population but not in all male races/ethnicities or anatomical site-specific cancers. Moreover, the majority of the counties having the top-most cancer incidence rate in females are located above the latitude 36.5°N. These findings indicate that living in a cold county in the United States might have a higher risk of cancer irrespective of cancer type (except cervical and liver) and races/ethnicities for females but not in all such cases for the male population.	2017
28989791	Sweepstake evolution revealed by population-genetic analysis of copy-number alterations in single genomes of breast cancer.	Single-cell sequencing is a promising technology that can address cancer cell evolution by identifying genetic alterations in individual cells. In a recent study, genome-wide DNA copy numbers of single cells were accurately quantified by single-cell sequencing in breast cancers. Phylogenetic-tree analysis revealed genetically distinct populations, each consisting of homogeneous cells. Bioinformatics methods based on population genetics should be further developed to quantitatively analyse the single-cell sequencing data. We developed a bioinformatics framework that was combined with molecular-evolution theories to analyse copy-number losses. This analysis revealed that most deletions in the breast cancers at the single-cell level were generated by simple stochastic processes. A non-standard type of coalescent theory, the multiple-merger coalescent model, aided by approximate Bayesian computation fit well with the data, allowing us to estimate the population-genetic parameters in addition to false-positive and false-negative rates. The estimated parameters suggest that the cancer cells underwent sweepstake evolution, where only one or very few parental cells produced a descendent cell population. We conclude that breast cancer cells successively substitute in a tumour mass, and the high reproduction of only a portion of cancer cells may confer high adaptability to this cancer.	2017
28932764	Antisense Oligonucleotide-mediated Knockdown in Mammary Tumor Organoids.	Primary mammary tumor organoids grown in 3D are an excellent system to study tumor biology. They resemble the organization and physiology of native epithelia more closely than cancer cell lines grown in 2D, and additionally model interactions with the ECM (Boj et al., 2015; Clevers, 2016; Shamir and Ewald, 2014). Mammary tumor organoids are therefore a promising model system to identify and characterize novel drivers of breast cancer that would be unlikely to be identified using 2D cell lines. Antisense oligonucleotides can be used to efficiently and specifically knockdown target genes in the cell (Bennett et al., 2017). They can be taken up freely by organoids without the need for a transfection agent, making them a convenient tool for routine lab studies and screens.	2017
28921303	Registry study to assess hair loss prevention with the Penguin Cold Cap in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.	Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a distressing side effect of cancer treatment. The aim of this registry study was to assess efficacy and tolerability of scalp hypothermia using Penguin Cold Caps (Penguin) in breast cancer patients.	Hair loss was assessed by patients using a 100-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and by physicians using the 5-point Dean Scale at baseline, every 3-4 weeks during chemotherapy, and at least 1 month after completion of chemotherapy. The primary efficacy endpoint for success was defined as ≤50% hair loss by patient report (VAS) at follow-up (FUP). Tolerability and satisfaction were assessed by patient report.	103 patients enrolled between 7/2010 and 6/2015; 97 are evaluable for the primary endpoint. Chemotherapy included docetaxel/cyclophosphamide (TC; n = 50) for 4-6 cycles every 3 weeks, weekly paclitaxel for 12 weeks then doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (P/AC; n = 23) for 4 cycles every 2-3 weeks, AC then paclitaxel (AC/P; n = 10), docetaxel/carboplatin ± trastuzumab (TCH; n = 4) for 4-6 cycles every 3 weeks. Overall, 61% of patients successfully prevented CIA; impact was regimen specific: TCH 100%, TC × 4 84%, TC × 5-6 50%, P/AC 43%, AC/P 20%. The most common toxicity was headache, reported by 78.5% of patients with mean pain level 37/100. Satisfaction among those who completed scalp cooling (SC) and FUP ranged from 74 to 100%. All patients who completed SC/FUP recommended Penguin.	Scalp hypothermia with Penguin is effective in reducing alopecia, particularly for non-anthracycline-based shorter regimens. Penguin was well tolerated and viewed favorably by most patients.	2018
28891826	Injection Volume and Anesthetic Effect in Serratus Plane Block.	Serratus plane block is performed for analgesia of the anterior chest wall. However, there has been no study concerning the appropriate volume for this block. This prospective randomized controlled study assesses the dermatomal spread and analgesic effects of serratus plane block.	Ultrasound-guided serratus plane block was performed for breast cancer surgery. The patients were randomly assigned to receive 20 or 40 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine. The primary end point was the number of affected dermatomes as assessed by cold test and pinprick test 20 minutes after the block procedure. Secondary end points were the time until the first postoperative analgesic rescue, adverse effects, and complications.	The number of affected dermatomes assessed by the cold test for patients receiving 40 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine was significantly larger than that for patients receiving 20 mL (P = 0.002; 6 [5-7] vs 4 [3-4] dermatomes). Similarly, with the pinprick test, the affected area was larger for the 40 mL group than for the 20 mL group (P = 0.009; 4 [2-6] vs 2 [1-3] dermatomes). There were no differences between the 2 groups in secondary end points.	Ultrasound-guided serratus plane block spread in the craniocaudal direction is more widespread with 40 mL than with 20 mL of 0.375% ropivacaine. The time until the first postoperative analgesic rescue dose was not extended by a larger volume of injection.	UMIN Clinical Trials Registry (identifier UMIN000016549).
28887025	Tryptone-stabilized gold nanoparticles target tubulin and inhibit cell viability by inducing an unusual form of cell cycle arrest.	Gold nanoparticles have been investigated extensively for their molecular mechanisms of action and anticancer potential. We report a novel, tubulin-targeted antiproliferative mechanism of action of tryptone-stabilized gold nanoparticles (TsAuNPs). TsAuNPs, synthesized using HAuCl4·3H2O and tryptone and characterized by a variety of spectroscopic methods and transmission electron microscopy, were found to be inhibitory to viability of human pancreatic (PANC-1), cervical (HeLa), and breast (MDA-MB-231) cancer cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner, with highest efficacy against PANC-1 cells. The particles strongly inhibited the clonogenic propagation of PANC-1 cells. TsAuNPs-mediated inhibition of cell viability involved an unusual mode of cell cycle arrest (arrest at both G0/G1 phase and S-phase) followed by apoptosis. In vitro, TsAuNPs bound purified tubulin, competitively inhibited anilinonaphthalene sulfonate binding to tubulin, and suppressed tubulin assembly. In cells, tubulin-TsAuNPs interactions were manifested as a disrupted microtubule network, defective reassembly of cold-disassembled microtubules, and induction of tubulin acetylation. Our data indicate that TsAuNPs inhibit cell viability by inducing differential cell cycle arrest possibly through disrupted dynamicity of cellular microtubules.	2017
28884080	Antibacterial, antioxidant and cell proliferative properties of Coccinia grandis fruits.	Little knowledge is available on the antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of Coccina grandis fruits and no study has reported on its cell proliferative property. The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial, antioxidant and cell proliferative property of fruits of C. grandis.	Fruits of C. grandis were extracted using water; ethanol and acetone by cold and hot Soxhlet extraction. The antibacterial activities of the extracts were tested against Staphylococcusaureus,Enterococcusfaecalis,Escherichiacoli and Pseudomonasaeruginosa using the modified Kirby-Bauer diffusion method and compared against erythromycin. The antioxidant property was determined using Cayman's antioxidant assay; whereas cell proliferation/cytotoxic properties were evaluated using the Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell MTS assay with MDA-MB 321 breast cancer cells. Data were analyzed for correlation and differences using unpaired student's t-test and one-way ANOVA. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.	Both cold and hot ethanol and acetone extracts of C. grandis fruits showed some degree of bacterial growth inhibition. Acetone extracts exhibited higher antibacterial activity. Both ethanol extracts showed antioxidant property when compared with standard Trolox. In contrary to cytotoxicity, all four extracts showed cell proliferation compared to controls at different concentrations. However, acetone extracts exhibited greater cell proliferation compared to ethanol extracts and cold extracts performed better than the hot extracts.	C. grandis fruits exhibited some degree of antimicrobial, antioxidant and cell proliferative properties. Further investigation is warranted to isolate, confirm and characterize phytochemicals that are responsible for the medicinal properties observed.
28883477	The Strong Cell-based Hydrogen Peroxide Generation Triggered by Cold Atmospheric Plasma.	Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important signaling molecule in cancer cells. However, the significant secretion of H2O2 by cancer cells have been rarely observed. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is a near room temperature ionized gas composed of neutral particles, charged particles, reactive species, and electrons. Here, we first demonstrated that breast cancer cells and pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells generated micromolar level H2O2 during just 1 min of direct CAP treatment on these cells. The cell-based H2O2 generation is affected by the medium volume, the cell confluence, as well as the discharge voltage. The application of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) in cancer treatment has been intensively investigated over the past decade. Several cellular responses to CAP treatment have been observed including the consumption of the CAP-originated reactive species, the rise of intracellular reactive oxygen species, the damage on DNA and mitochondria, as well as the activation of apoptotic events. This is a new previously unknown cellular response to CAP, which provides a new prospective to understand the interaction between CAP and cells in vitro and in vivo. The short-lived reactive species in CAP may activate cells in vivo to generate long-lived reactive species such as H2O2, which may trigger immune attack on tumorous tissues via the H2O2-mediated lymphocyte activation.	2017
28877932	Detection and genomic characterization of a mammary-like adenocarcinoma.	Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing were performed to identify potential therapeutic strategies in the absence of viable treatment options for a patient initially diagnosed with vulvar adenocarcinoma. Genomic events were prioritized by comparison against variant distributions in the TCGA pan-cancer data set and complemented with detailed transcriptome sequencing and copy-number analysis. These findings were considered against published scientific literature in order to evaluate the functional effects of potentially relevant genomic events. Analysis of the transcriptome against a background of 27 TCGA cancer types led to reclassification of the tumor as a primary HER2+ mammary-like adenocarcinoma of the vulva. This revised diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by follow-up immunohistochemistry for a mammary-like adenocarcinoma. The patient was treated with chemotherapy and targeted therapies for HER2+ breast cancer. The detailed pathology and genomic findings of this case are presented herein.	2017
28835367	FGFR2 amplification in colorectal adenocarcinoma.	FGFR2 is recurrently amplified in 5% of gastric cancers and 1%-4% of breast cancers; however, this molecular alteration has never been reported in a primary colorectal cancer specimen. Preclinical studies indicate that several FGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as AZD4547, have in vitro activity against the FGFR2-amplified colorectal cell line, NCI-H716. The efficacy of these inhibitors is currently under investigation in clinical trials for breast and gastric cancer. Thus, better characterizing colorectal tumors for FGFR2 amplification could identify a subset of patients who may benefit from FGFR TKI therapies. Here, we describe a novel FGFR2 amplification identified by clinical next-generation sequencing in a primary colorectal cancer. Further characterization of the tumor by immunohistochemistry showed neuroendocrine differentiation, similar to the reported properties of the NCI-H716 cell line. These findings demonstrate that the spectrum of potentially clinically actionable mutations detected by targeted clinical sequencing panels is not limited to only single-nucleotide polymorphisms and insertions/deletions but also to copy-number alterations.	2017
28824738	Breast cancer and Flammer syndrome: any symptoms in common for prediction, prevention and personalised medical approach?	An epidemic scale of the breast cancer (BC) prevalence is actually recognised as the reality of the early twenty-first century. Particularly alarming is that the sporadic BC (about 90% of all patients) creates currently unpredictable subpopulations in terms of disease predisposition, development and progression. Despite broad discussions run since years in BC area, no any plausible approach has been suggested so far to get the overall situation better controlled in the populations. Here, we present highly innovative concepts considering investigation of specific syndromes and symptoms underestimated till now in relationship with BC predisposition and development. Consequently, the purpose of our pilot project was to evaluate the prevalence of Flammer Syndrome (FS) in BC patient cohort. The results achieved here support the main hypothesis of the project clearly demonstrating the tendency of BC patients to the increased prevalence of FS symptoms compared to the disease-free individuals. Our study strongly indicates the relevance of FS symptoms for BC pathology such as feeling inadequately cold, deficient thermoregulation, altered sensitivity to different stimuli, potential dehydration, altered sleep patterns, tendency towards headache, migraine attacks and dizziness. Moreover, the symptoms' appearance is specifically linked to the individual BC subtypes. Potential mechanisms interconnecting FS with BC pathology are discussed.	2017
28814071	Feasibility of Charcoal Tattooing of Cytology-Proven Metastatic Axillary Lymph Node at Diagnosis and Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer Patients.	Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be performed when node-positive disease is converted to node-negative status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT). Tattooing nodes might improve accuracy but supportive data are limited. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of charcoal tattooing metastatic axillary lymph node (ALN) at presentation followed by SLNB after NCT in breast cancers.	Twenty patientswith cytology-proven node metastases prospectively underwent charcoal tattooing at diagnosis. SLNB using dual tracers and axillary surgery after NCT were then performed. The detection rate of tattooed node and diagnostic performance of SLNB were analyzed.	All patients underwent charcoal tattooingwithout significant morbidity. Sentinel and tattooed nodes could be detected during surgery after NCT. Nodal pathologic complete response was achieved in 10 patients. Overall sensitivity, false-negative rate (FNR), negative predictive value, and accuracy of hot/blue SLNB were 80.0%, 20.0%, 83.3%, and 90.0%, respectively. Retrieving more nodes and favorable nodal response were associated with improved performance. The best accuracy was observed when excised tattooed node was calculated together (FNR, 0.0%). Cold/non-blue tattooed nodes of five patients were removed during non-sentinel axillary surgery but clinicopathological parameters did not differ compared to patients with hot/blue tattooed node detected during SLNB, suggesting the importance of the tattooing procedure itself to improve performance.	Charcoal tattooing of cytology-confirmed metastatic ALN at presentation is technically feasible and does not limit SLNB after NCT. The tattooing procedure without additional preoperative localization is advantageous for improving the diagnostic performance of SLNB in this setting.	2018
28810140	New Views into the Genetic Landscape of Metastatic Breast Cancer.	Whether metastasis-specific genetic alterations exist remains controversial. The study by Yates et al. in this issue of Cancer Cell provides evidence that metastases emerge late during primary breast cancer progression and that additional driver mutations are often acquired, posing both challenges and opportunities for precision treatment of metastatic breast cancer.	2017
28679691	Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer patient with TP53 tumor mutation experienced 11 months progression-free survival on bortezomib monotherapy without adverse events after ending standard treatments with grade 3 adverse events.	A triple-negative breast cancer patient had no hereditary BRCA1, BRCA2, or TP53 risk variants. After exhaustion of standard treatments, she underwent experimental treatments and whole-exome sequencing of tumor, blood, and a metastasis. Well-tolerated experimental bortezomib monotherapy was administered for a progression-free period of 11 mo. After progression, treatments were changed and the exome data were evaluated, expanded with RNA and exome sequencing of a late-stage metastasis. In the final stage, eribulin alone and in combination with anthracyclines were administered. While suffering from grade 3 adverse events, skin metastases progressed. She lived 51 mo after initial diagnosis.Toxicity from anthracyclines and cisplatin may have been due to associated germline variants CBR3 C4Y and V224M and GSTP1 I105V, respectively. Somatic mutations predicted or reported as pathogenic were detected in 38 genes in tumor tissues. All tumor samples harbored the heterozygous TP53 Y220C variant, known to destabilize p53 and down-regulate p53-mediated apoptosis. The success of bortezomib may be explained by the previously reported up-regulation of caspase-mediated apoptosis, which is p53-independent. Phylogenetic analysis of blood, primary tumor, and two metastases inferred an ancestral tumor cell with 12 expressed tumor mutations from which all three tumors may have evolved.Although our first urgent analysis could only include 40 genes, postmortem analysis uncovered the aggressiveness and suggested experimental therapies including 16 actionable targets, partly validated by immunohistochemistry. Exome and transcriptome analyses yielded comprehensive therapy-relevant information and should be considered for patients at first diagnosis.	2017
28670332	Relationship between Chinese medicine dietary patterns and the incidence of breast cancer in Chinese women in Hong Kong: a retrospective cross-sectional survey.	This retrospective cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the relationship between Chinese medicine (CM) dietary patterns (hot, neutral, and cold) and the incidence of breast cancer among Chinese women in Hong Kong.	Breast cancer cases (n = 202) and healthy controls (n = 202) were matched according to demographics. Chinese women residing in Hong Kong for the past 7 years were recruited by media advertisements (e.g., via newspapers, radio, and posters). The control participants were recruited by convenience sampling from health workshops held in clinics and communities of 15 districts of Hong Kong. After completing test-retest reliability, all participants were asked to complete diet pattern questionnaires about their food preferences and dietary patterns. The Student's unpaired t test, Chi square test, and logistic regression were conducted using SPSS software.	Three major CM dietary patterns were identified: hot, neutral, and cold. The participants with breast cancer exhibited a stronger preference for hot food than the control group (Chi square test, P < 0.001). A higher frequency of breast cancer was associated with a higher frequency of dining out for breakfast (4-5 times per week, Chi square test, P = 0.015; 6-7 times per week, Chi square test, P < 0.001) and lunch (4-5 times per week, Chi square test, P < 0.001; 6-7 times per week, Chi square test, P = 0.006). The participants with no history of breast cancer consumed CM supplements and Guangdong soups (1-2 times per week, Chi square test, P = 0.05; >3 times per week, Chi square test, P < 0.001) more frequently than those with breast cancer.	Non-breast cancer participants adopted a neutral (healthy and balanced) dietary pattern, and consumed CM supplements and Guangdong soups more frequently.	2017
28666851	Cold atmospheric plasma restores tamoxifen sensitivity in resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cell.	Cancer recurrence, which is frequently accompanied by chemotherapy, has been a challenge in cancer treatment. This study was carried out to examine the potential applications of the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) to overcome the cancer cells' drug resistance, which has been emerging as an alternative therapeutic tool for cancer. For this, we developed a tamoxifen (Tam)-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/TamR) breast cancer cell model and examined the effect of CAP on the recovery of Tam sensitivity at the cellular and molecular level. The ROS level was increased 1.9-fold in CAP-treated MCF-7/TamR cells compared to the non-treated cell. CAP was proven to restore sensitivity by up to 50% for MCF-7/TamR cells against Tam after CAP treatment. The comparison of genome-wide expression between the acquisition of Tam resistance and CAP treatment identified 20 genes that commonly showed significant expression changes. Notably, all the genes except two have been oppositely dysregulated in the two cellular statuses, and the majority of them are known to contribute to the acquisition of Tam resistance. The protein expression of selected genes, MX1 and HOXC6, was recovered to that of their parental cell by CAP. Furthermore, the dysregulation of MX1 and HOXC6 in MCF-7/TamR alleviated the drug sensitivity recovery effect of CAP. Taken together, CAP inhibited the growth of Tam-resistant MCF-7 cancer cells and reset it to the Tam-sensitive status by restoring the expression of drug resistance-related genes. These findings may lend credence to CAP as an alternative or complementary tool in the treatment or prevention of Tam-resistant cancer.	2017
28661759	Adjuvant Cyclophosphamide and Docetaxel With or Without Epirubicin for Early TOP2A-Normal Breast Cancer: DBCG 07-READ, an Open-Label, Phase III, Randomized Trial.	Purpose Administration of anthracycline and taxane therapy in the adjuvant setting is considered a standard for breast cancer. We evaluated a non-anthracycline-based regimen in TOP2A-normal patients. Patients and Methods In this multicenter, open-label, phase III trial, 2,012 women with early TOP2A-normal breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor were randomly assigned to receive six cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) every 3 weeks (DC) or three cycles of epirubicin (90 mg/m2) and cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) followed by three cycles of docetaxel (100 mg/m2; EC-D). The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS) after a median of 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points were patient-reported toxicity, overall survival (OS), and distant disease-free survival. Results At a median estimated potential follow-up of 69 months, 5-year DFS was 87.9% (95% CI, 85.6% to 89.8%) in the EC-D arm and 88.3% (95% CI, 86.1% to 90.1%) in the DC arm. There was no significant difference in the risk of DFS events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.00; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.28; P = 1.00), distant disease-free survival (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.47; P = .40), or mortality (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.59; P = .41) in the intent-to-treat analysis. A significant interaction between menopausal status and treatment group was observed for DFS (P = .04) but not for OS (P = .07). Patients with grade 3 tumors derived most benefit from DC, and patients with grade 1 to 2 tumors derived most benefit from EC-D (DFS: interaction P = .02; and OS: interaction P = .03). Patients receiving EC-D reported significantly more stomatitis, myalgia or arthralgia, vomiting, nausea, fatigue, and peripheral neuropathy, whereas edema was more frequent after DC. Conclusion This study provides evidence to support no overall outcome benefit from adjuvant anthracyclines in patients with early TOP2A-normal breast cancer.	2017
28658097	A thermal dysregulation problem after breast cancer surgery; what could be?	Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a complicated disorder characterized by severe fatigue that is not relieved with rest and associated with physical symptoms such as sleep problems, headache, muscle pain, or joint pain.	Forty-one year old patient complained from feeling cold after breast cancer surgery.	The diagnoses of fibromyalgia, depression, neurological, psychiatric, and vascular disorders were excluded by appropriate clinical and laboratory investigations. She was diagnosed as CFS.	The patient was treated successfully via aerobic exercise therapy that scheduled for 30 min at least 3 days per week.	At 6-month follow-up, her complaints were almost resolved and the patient regained her physical health and mental attitude.	A thermal dysregulation should be taken into consideration as one of the symptoms of CFS.	2017
28643329	Analgesic Plasma Concentrations of Oxycodone After Surgery for Breast Cancer-Which Factors Matter?	We investigated factors affecting analgesic oxycodone concentrations after breast cancer surgery in 1,000 women. Preoperatively, we studied heat and cold pain sensitivities and anxiety scores. Postoperatively, rest and motion pain intensities were measured and intravenous oxycodone was administered until satisfactory analgesia. At this point, the mean oxycodone concentration (variation coefficient) was 33.3 ng/mL (66%) and it was 21.7 ng/mL (69%) when the patient requested oxycodone again. At both time points, the concentrations varied >100-fold between individuals. The analgesic oxycodone concentration was increased by 21.3% per motion pain intensity score on a 0-10 scale and by 22.3% if axillary clearance was performed instead of sentinel node biopsy (P < 0.001). Forty-seven women who were older and less anxious than others (P < 0.01) required no oxycodone. Anxiety, age, chronic pain, or preoperative pain sensitivity were not independently associated with the analgesic oxycodone concentration. CYP2D6 and CYP3A genotypes did not affect analgesic concentration or duration of analgesia.	2018
28620440	Feeling cold and other underestimated symptoms in breast cancer: anecdotes or individual profiles for advanced patient stratification?	Breast cancer (BC) epidemic is recognised as being characteristic for the early twenty-first century. BC is a multifactorial disease, and a spectrum of modifiable (preventable) factors significantly increasing risks has been described. This article highlights a series of underestimated symptoms for consequent BC risk assessment and patient stratification. Phenomena of the deficient thermoregulation, altered sensitivity to different stimuli (pain, thirst, smell, light, stress provocation), dehydration, altered circadian and sleep patterns, tendency towards headache, migraine attacks and dizziness, as well as local and systemic hypoxic effects are discussed for BC patients providing functional links and proposing new approaches in the overall BC management.	2017
28581356	Adjuvant Pertuzumab and Trastuzumab in Early HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.	Pertuzumab increases the rate of pathological complete response in the preoperative context and increases overall survival among patients with metastatic disease when it is added to trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. In this trial, we investigated whether pertuzumab, when added to adjuvant trastuzumab and chemotherapy, improves outcomes among patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer.	We randomly assigned patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative HER2-positive, operable breast cancer to receive either pertuzumab or placebo added to standard adjuvant chemotherapy plus 1 year of treatment with trastuzumab. We assumed a 3-year invasive-disease-free survival rate of 91.8% with pertuzumab and 89.2% with placebo.	In the trial population, 63% of the patients who were randomly assigned to receive pertuzumab (2400 patients) or placebo (2405 patients) had node-positive disease and 36% had hormone-receptor-negative disease. Disease recurrence occurred in 171 patients (7.1%) in the pertuzumab group and 210 patients (8.7%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 1.00; P=0.045). The estimates of the 3-year rates of invasive-disease-free survival were 94.1% in the pertuzumab group and 93.2% in the placebo group. In the cohort of patients with node-positive disease, the 3-year rate of invasive-disease-free survival was 92.0% in the pertuzumab group, as compared with 90.2% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for an invasive-disease event, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P=0.02). In the cohort of patients with node-negative disease, the 3-year rate of invasive-disease-free survival was 97.5% in the pertuzumab group and 98.4% in the placebo group (hazard ratio for an invasive-disease event, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.86; P=0.64). Heart failure, cardiac death, and cardiac dysfunction were infrequent in both treatment groups. Diarrhea of grade 3 or higher occurred almost exclusively during chemotherapy and was more frequent with pertuzumab than with placebo (9.8% vs. 3.7%).	Pertuzumab significantly improved the rates of invasive-disease-free survival among patients with HER2-positive, operable breast cancer when it was added to trastuzumab and chemotherapy. Diarrhea was more common with pertuzumab than with placebo. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech; APHINITY ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01358877 .).	2017
28552722	A novel immuno-gold labeling protocol for nanobody-based detection of HER2 in breast cancer cells using immuno-electron microscopy.	Immuno-electron microscopy is commonly performed with the use of antibodies. In the last decade the antibody fragment indicated as nanobody (VHH or single domain antibody) has found its way to different applications previously done with conventional antibodies. Nanobodies can be selected to bind with high affinity and specificity to different antigens. They are small (molecular weight ca. 15kDa) and are usually easy to produce in microorganisms. Here we have evaluated the feasibility of a nanobody binding to HER2 for application in immuno-electron microscopy. To obtain highest labeling efficiency combined with optimal specificity, different labeling conditions were analysed, which included nanobody concentration, fixation and blocking conditions. The obtained optimal protocol was applied for post-embedment labeling of Tokuyasu cryosections and for pre-embedment labeling of HER2 for fluorescence microscopy and both transmission and scanning electron microscopy. We show that formaldehyde fixation after incubation with the anti-HER2 nanobody, improves labeling intensity. Among all tested blocking agents the best results were obtained with a mixture of cold water fish gelatine and acetylated bovine serum albumin, which prevented a-specific interactions causing background labeling while preserving specific interactions at the same time. In conclusion, we have developed a nanobody-based protocol for immuno-gold labeling of HER2 for Tokuyasu cryosections in TEM as well as for pre-embedment gold labeling of cells for both TEM and SEM.	2017
28550924	New perspective on the in vivo use of cold stress dynamic thermography in integumental reconstruction with the use of skin-muscle flaps.	Among the problems encountered by plastic surgeons is the reconstruction of defects following tumors. One of the reconstructive options is trans rectus abdominis (TRAM) flap. Despite that anatomy is well explored, marginal flap necrosis may develop. To minimize the complications, imaging examinations were designed to determine the degree of flap perfusion. One of them is the thermographic examination.	We examined 38 patients who had undergone 10 reconstructive breast surgeries with a pedicled TRAM ipsilateral flap, 10 patients with a TRAM contralateral flap, and 18 patients with a TRAM supercharged flap. Each operated patient underwent a thermographic examination before the surgery, after the dissection of the skin-muscle flap, immediately after suturing flap, and during the first and seventh day after the surgery. The collected data were then processed to yield results in a numerical form and compared with clinical examination. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of new thermal model calculation of dTnorm and t90_10 in cold stress dynamic thermography in the in vivo assessment of intraoperative and postoperative skin blood supply in humans before ischemic lesions become clinically apparent.	Of 38 patients participating in the study, nine patients developed marginal necrosis of the skin flap despite intraoperative clinical evaluation of blood supply. Explicit circulatory disorders apparent in a clinical examination developed after 24 h.	Cold stress tnorm and t90_10 dynamic thermography can be a helpful additional tool to assess and monitor the blood supply to the flap skin both intraoperatively and postoperatively.

28550065	Exceptional durable response to everolimus in a patient with biphenotypic breast cancer harboring an STK11 variant.	Metastatic triple-negative breast cancer comprises 12%-17% of breast cancers and carries a poor prognosis relative to other breast cancer subtypes. Treatment options in this disease are largely limited to systemic chemotherapy. A majority of clinical studies assessing efficacy of targeted therapeutics (e.g., the mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] inhibitor everolimus) in advanced breast cancer patients have not utilized predictive genomic biomarker-based selection and have reported only modest improvement in the clinical outcome relative to standard of care. However, recent reports have highlighted significant clinical responses of breast malignancies harboring alterations in genes involved in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway to mTOR-inhibitor-involving regimens, underscoring the potential clinical benefit of treating subsets of breast cancer patients with molecularly matched targeted therapies. As the paradigm of cancer treatment shifts from chemotherapeutic regimens to more personalized approaches, the identification of additional reliable biomarkers is essential for identifying patients likely to derive maximum benefit from targeted therapies. Herein, we report a near-complete and ongoing 14-mo response to everolimus therapy of a heavily pretreated patient with biphenotypic, metastatic breast cancer. Genomic profiling of the metastatic triple-negative liver specimen identified a single reportable point mutation, STK11 F354L, that appears to have undergone loss of heterozygosity. No other alterations within the PI3K/mTOR pathway were observed. Published functional biochemical data on this variant are conflicting, and germline data, albeit with unclear zygosity status, are suggestive of a benign polymorphism role. Together with the preclinical data, this case suggests further investigation of this variant is warranted to better understand its role as a potential biomarker for mTOR inhibitor sensitivity in the appropriate clinical context.	2017
28541714	A Multivariate Evaluation of Factors Affecting the Quality of Freshly Frozen Tissue Specimens.	Well-prepared and preserved freshly frozen specimens are indispensable materials for clinical studies. To manage specimen quality and to understand the factors potentially affecting specimen quality during preservation processes, we analyzed the quality of RNA and genomic DNA of various tissues collected between 2002 and 2011 in Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. During this period, a total of 1059 freshly frozen specimens from eight major cancer categories were examined. It was found that preservation duration, organ origin, and tissue type could all influence the quality of RNA samples. The increased preservation period correlated with decreased RNA quality; the brain, breast, and stomach RNA specimens displayed faster degradation rates than those of other organs, and RNA specimens isolated from tumor tissues were apparently more stable than those of other tissues. These factors could all be used as quality predictors of RNA quality. In contrast, almost all analyses revealed that the genomic DNA samples had good quality, which was not influenced by the aforementioned factors. The results assisted us in determining preservation factors that affect specimen quality, which could provide evidence for improving processes of sample collection and preservation. Furthermore, the results are also useful for researchers to adopt as the evaluation criteria for choosing specimen collection and preservation strategies.	2017
28514723	Genomic profiling of pelvic genital type leiomyosarcoma in a woman with a germline CHEK2:c.1100delC mutation and a concomitant diagnosis of metastatic invasive ductal breast carcinoma.	We describe a woman with the known pathogenic germline variant CHEK2:c.1100delC and synchronous diagnoses of both pelvic genital type leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and metastatic invasive ductal breast carcinoma. CHEK2 (checkpoint kinase 2) is a tumor-suppressor gene encoding a serine/threonine-protein kinase (CHEK2) involved in double-strand DNA break repair and cell cycle arrest. The CHEK2:c.1100delC variant is a moderate penetrance allele resulting in an approximately twofold increase in breast cancer risk. Whole-genome and whole-transcriptome sequencing were performed on the leiomyosarcoma and matched blood-derived DNA. Despite the presence of several genomic hits within the double-strand DNA damage pathway (CHEK2 germline variant and multiple RAD51B somatic structural variants), tumor profiling did not show an obvious DNA repair deficiency signature. However, even though the LMS displayed clear malignant features, its genomic profiling revealed several characteristics classically associated with leiomyomas including a translocation, t(12;14), with one breakpoint disrupting RAD51B and the other breakpoint upstream of HMGA2 with very high expression of HMGA2 and PLAG1 This is the first report of LMS genomic profiling in a patient with the germline CHEK2:c.1100delC variant and an additional diagnosis of metastatic invasive ductal breast carcinoma. We also describe a possible mechanistic relationship between leiomyoma and LMS based on genomic and transcriptome data. Our findings suggest that RAD51B translocation and HMGA2 overexpression may play an important role in LMS oncogenesis.	2017
28507022	Loss of E-Cadherin-Dependent Cell-Cell Adhesion and the Development and Progression of Cancer.	Classical cadherins are the key molecules that control cell-cell adhesion. Notwithstanding this function, it is also clear that classical cadherins are more than just the "glue" that keeps the cells together. Cadherins are essential regulators of tissue homeostasis that govern multiple facets of cellular function and development, by transducing adhesive signals to a complex network of signaling effectors and transcriptional programs. In cancer, cadherins are often inactivated or functionally inhibited, resulting in disease development and/or progression. This review focuses on E-cadherin and its causal role in the development and progression of breast and gastric cancer. We provide a summary of the biochemical consequences and consider the conceptual impact of early (mutational) E-cadherin loss in cancer. We advocate that carcinomas driven by E-cadherin loss should be considered "actin-diseases," caused by the specific disruption of the E-cadherin-actin connection and a subsequent dependence on sustained actomyosin contraction for tumor progression. Based on the available data from mouse and human studies we discuss opportunities for targeted clinical intervention.	2018

28422401	MLC-based penumbra softener of EDW borders to reduce junction inhomogeneities.	Junctions of fields are known to be susceptible to developing cold or hot spots in the presence of even small geometrical misalignments. Reduction of these dose inhomogeneities can be accomplished through decreasing the dose gradients in the penumbra, but currently it cannot be done for enhanced dynamic wedges (EDW). An MLC-based penumbra softener was developed in the developer mode of TrueBeam linacs to reduce dose gradients across the side border of EDWs. The movement of each leaf was individually synchronized with the movement of the dynamic Y jaw to soften the penumbra in the same manner along the entire field border, in spite of the presence of the dose gradient of the EDW. Junction homogeneity upon field misalignment for side-matched EDWs was examined with the MV imager. The fluence inhomogeneities were reduced from about 30% per mm of shift of the field borders for the conventional EDW to about 2% per mm for the softened-penumbra plan. The junction in a four-field monoisocentric breast plan delivered to the Rando phantom was assessed with film. The dose inhomogeneities across the junction in the superior-inferior direction were reduced from about 20% to 25% per mm for the conventional fields to about 5% per mm. The dose near the softened junction of the breast plan with no shifts did not deviate from the conventional plan by more than about 4%. The newly-developed softened-penumbra junction of EDW (and/or open) fields was shown to reduce sensitivity to misalignments without increasing complexity of the planning or delivery. This methodology needs to be adopted by the manufacturers for clinical use.	2017

28416576	Pathways Involved in Formation of Mammary Organoid Architecture Have Keys to Understanding Drug Resistance and to Discovery of Druggable Targets.	Signals from the extracellular matrix (ECM) are received at the cell surface receptor, transmitted to the cytoskeletons, and transferred to the nucleus and chromatin for tissue- and context-specific gene expression. Cells, in return, modulate the cell shape and ECM, allowing for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis as well as for coevolution and adaptation to the environmental signals. We postulated the existence of dynamic and reciprocal interactions between the ECM and the nucleus more than three decades ago, but now these pathways have been proven experimentally thanks to the advances in imaging and cell/molecular biology techniques. In this review, we will introduce some of our recent work that has validated the critical roles of the three-dimensional (3D) tissue architecture in determining mammary biology, therapeutic response, and druggable targets. We describe a novel screen based on reversion of the malignant phenotype in 3D assays. We will also summarize our recent discoveries of the integration of feedback signaling for mammary acinar formation and phenotypic reversion of tumor cells in the LrECM. Lastly, we will introduce our exciting discovery of the physical linkages between the cell surface and cytofibers within a tunnel deep inside of the nucleus, enabling interaction with nuclear lamin and SUN proteins.	2016
28381439	Tumor-Stroma Interactions in Bone Metastasis: Molecular Mechanisms and Therapeutic Implications.	Metastasis and associated complications are the major cause of death for cancer patients. The incidence of bone metastasis is among the highest in cancers arising from breast, prostate, and lung. Common skeletal-related events caused by bone metastasis include aberrant bone remodeling (osteolytic, osteoblastic, and mixed), bone pain, fracture, spinal cord compression, and life-threatening hypercalcemia. It is now known that interactions between tumor cells and bone stroma lie at the core of major steps of bone-metastasis progression. Approved pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of bone metastasis, including bisphosphonate and denosumab, were designed to target bone stromal cell components. In recent years, research in our laboratory and others has revealed intricate tumor-stroma interactions as the driving force behind osteolytic bone-metastasis development, providing a set of new candidates for future drug development. Moreover, recent studies also indicate existence of distinct bone niches in supporting hematopoietic stem cell renewal and differentiation. These niche components are likely utilized by metastatic cancer cells for seeding, progression, and therapy resistance of bone metastasis. Future studies in this direction may discover additional therapeutic targets for bone-metastasis treatment.	2016
28381438	Modeling Breast Cancer Intertumor and Intratumor Heterogeneity Using Xenografts.	Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease that can be stratified in at least 10 different subtypes. We present here a platform for derivation of preclinical models based on patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDTXs) that represent these subgroups. These models preserve the transcriptome, methylome, copy-number, and mutational landscape features of the tumor of origin through different passaging. Furthermore, the intratumoral composition of these models is formed by communities of clones very similar to the ones present in the originating tumor. Finally, we show that short-term cultures of cells from these models (PDTX-derived tumor cells, PDTCs) also preserve the molecular features of the tumor and can be used for high-throughput drug testing of single compounds or combinations, with high reproducibility and clinical predictive power.	2016
28337968	CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis invalidates a putative cancer dependency targeted in on-going clinical trials.	The Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase (MELK) has been reported to be a genetic dependency in several cancer types. MELK RNAi and small-molecule inhibitors of MELK block the proliferation of various cancer cell lines, and MELK knockdown has been described as particularly effective against the highly-aggressive basal/triple-negative subtype of breast cancer. Based on these preclinical results, the MELK inhibitor OTS167 is currently being tested as a novel chemotherapy agent in several clinical trials. Here, we report that mutagenizing MELK with CRISPR/Cas9 has no effect on the fitness of basal breast cancer cell lines or cell lines from six other cancer types. Cells that harbor null mutations in MELK exhibit wild-type doubling times, cytokinesis, and anchorage-independent growth. Furthermore, MELK-knockout lines remain sensitive to OTS167, suggesting that this drug blocks cell division through an off-target mechanism. In total, our results undermine the rationale for a series of current clinical trials and provide an experimental approach for the use of CRISPR/Cas9 in preclinical target validation that can be broadly applied.	2017
28323490	Triterpenoid Acids as Important Antiproliferative Constituents of European Elderberry Fruits.	In Europe, both the fruits and flowers of Sambucus nigra L. have been used against cold, as well as laxative, diaphoretic, and diuretic remedies. There are also a number of commercially available food products that contain elderberry juice, puréed or dried elderberries. Recent comprehensive literature data on pharmacology and chemistry of Sambuci fructus have encouraged us to screen extracts with different polarities from this plant material against cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic activity of the ethyl acetate and aqueous acetone extracts from elderberries as well as detected triterpenoids on human colon adenocarcinoma cell line (LoVo) and human breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) was investigated by sulforhodamine B assay. Moreover, cell migration assay was conducted for triterpenoid fraction and pure compounds. Aqueous acetone extract possessed much lower IC50 value in cancer cell lines compared to ethyl acetate extract. The latter manifested high cytotoxicity against studied cell lines, suggesting that nonpolar compounds are responsible for the cytotoxic activity. Indeed, the phytochemical analysis revealed that ursolic and oleanolic acids are the main triterpenoids in the mentioned extract of which ursolic acid showed the highest activity with IC50 values of 10.7 µg/mL on MCF-7 and 7.7 µg/mL on LoVo cells.
28237807	Effects of paclitaxel on the development of neuropathy and affective behaviors in the mouse.	Paclitaxel, one of the most commonly used cancer chemotherapeutic drugs, effectively extends the progression-free survival of breast, lung, and ovarian cancer patients. However, paclitaxel and other chemotherapy drugs elicit peripheral nerve fiber dysfunction or degeneration that leads to peripheral neuropathy in a large proportion of cancer patients. Patients receiving chemotherapy also often experience changes in mood, including anxiety and depression. These somatic and affective disorders represent major dose-limiting side effects of chemotherapy. Consequently, the present study was designed to develop a preclinical model of paclitaxel-induced negative affective symptoms in order to identify treatment strategies and their underlying mechanisms of action. Intraperitoneal injections of paclitaxel (8 mg/kg) resulted in the development and maintenance of mechanical and cold allodynia. Carboplatin, another cancer chemotherapeutic drug that is often used in combination with paclitaxel, sensitized mice to the nociceptive effects of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel also induced anxiety-like behavior, as assessed in the novelty suppressed feeding and light/dark box tests. In addition, paclitaxel-treated mice displayed depression-like behavior during the forced swim test and an anhedonia-like state in the sucrose preference test. In summary, paclitaxel produced altered behaviors in assays modeling affective states in C57BL/6J male mice, while increases in nociceptive responses were longer in duration. The characterization of this preclinical model of chemotherapy-induced allodynia and affective symptoms, possibly related to neuropathic pain, provides the basis for determining the mechanism(s) underlying severe side effects elicited by paclitaxel, as well as for predicting the efficacy of potential therapeutic interventions.	2017
28225974	Do you know this syndrome? Hand-foot syndrome.	Hand-foot syndrome is a common cutaneous adverse effect associated with certain systemic chemotherapy drugs. It is characterized by erythema, edema, and burning sensation, especially over palmoplantar surfaces. We report the case of an elderly patient undergoing chemotherapy after a breast cancer surgery who developed symptoms two months after the start of the regimen. There are no studies that explore specific therapies. Suggestive therapy include reducing agent dosage, increasing the interval between cycles, or even stopping chemotherapy. Emollients, analgesics, and cold packs are described as effective. After alopecia and mucositis, hand-foot syndrome is the most common adverse dermatologic reaction to chemotherapeutic agents.
28203723	Addition of transversus thoracic muscle plane block to pectoral nerves block provides more effective perioperative pain relief than pectoral nerves block alone for breast cancer surgery.	The pectoral nerves (PECS) block cannot block the most internal mammary region, whereas a transversus thoracic muscle plane (TTP) block can. The combination of PECS and TTP blocks may be suitable for anterior chest surgery. We studied patients undergoing mastectomy to assess whether the combination of PECS and TTP blocks provides better analgesia than PECS block alone.	Seventy adult female patients undergoing unilateral mastectomy under general anaesthesia were randomly allocated to receive either the combination of PECS and TTP blocks (PT group, n=35) or the PECS block only (C group, n=35). The primary outcome measure was visual analog scale pain score. Secondary outcomes were the sensory level loss confirmed by cold tests and additional analgesic drugs within 24 h after the operation.	The visual analog scale pain scores were lower in the PT group than the C group. The use of postoperative additional analgesic drugs was also lower lower in the PT group than that in the C group. In the majority of patients in the PT group, sensory loss was confirmed in both the anterior and the lateral branches of thoracic nerves (Th2–6).	Compared with PECS block, the combination of PECS and TTP blocks provides effective perioperative pain relief for breast cancer surgery.

28196257	Association Between Use of a Scalp Cooling Device and Alopecia After Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer.	Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a common and distressing adverse effect. In previous studies of scalp cooling to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia, conclusions have been limited.	To evaluate whether use of a scalp cooling system is associated with a lower amount of hair loss among women receiving specific chemotherapy regimens for early-stage breast cancer and to assess related changes in quality of life.	A prospective cohort study conducted at 5 US medical centers of women with stage I or II breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens excluding sequential or combination anthracycline and taxane (106 patients in the scalp cooling group and 16 in the control group; 14 matched by both age and chemotherapy regimen). The study was conducted between August 2013 and October 2014 with ongoing annual follow-up for 5 years.	Use of a scalp cooling system. Scalp cooling was initiated 30 minutes prior to each chemotherapy cycle, with scalp temperature maintained at 3°C (37°F) throughout chemotherapy and for 90 minutes to 120 minutes afterward.	Self-estimated hair loss using the Dean scale was assessed 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy by unblinded patient review of 5 photographs. A Dean scale score of 0 to 2 (≤50% hair loss) was defined as treatment success. A positive association between scalp cooling and reduced risk of hair loss would be demonstrated if 50% or more of patients in the scalp cooling group achieved treatment success, with the lower bound of the 95% CI greater than 40% of the success proportion. Quality of life was assessed at baseline, at the start of the last chemotherapy cycle, and 1 month later. Median follow-up was 29.5 months.	Among the 122 patients in the study, the mean age was 53 years (range, 28-77 years); 77.0% were white, 9.0% were black, and 10.7% were Asian; and the mean duration of chemotherapy was 2.3 months (median, 2.1 months). No participants in the scalp cooling group received anthracyclines. Hair loss of 50% or less (Dean score of 0-2) was seen in 67 of 101 patients (66.3%; 95% CI, 56.2%-75.4%) evaluable for alopecia in the scalp cooling group vs 0 of 16 patients (0%) in the control group (P < .001). Three of 5 quality-of-life measures were significantly better 1 month after the end of chemotherapy in the scalp cooling group. Of patients who underwent scalp cooling, 27.3% (95% CI, 18.0%-36.6%) reported feeling less physically attractive compared with 56.3% (95% CI, 31.9%-80.6%) of patients in the control group (P = .02). Of the 106 patients in the scalp cooling group, 4 (3.8%) experienced the adverse event of mild headache and 3 (2.8%) discontinued scalp cooling due to feeling cold.	Among women undergoing non-anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer, the use of scalp cooling vs no scalp cooling was associated with less hair loss at 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy. Further research is needed to assess outcomes after patients receive anthracycline regimens, longer-term measures of alopecia, and adverse effects.	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01831024.	2017
28194325	Serum YB-1 (Y-box binding protein 1) as a biomarker of bone disease progression in patients with breast cancer and bone metastases.	YB-1 (Y-box binding protein 1) is a multifunctional cold-shock protein that has been implicated in all hallmarks of cancer. Elevated YB-1 protein level was associated with poor prognosis in several types of cancers, including breast cancer (BC), where it is a marker of decreased overall survival (OS) and distant metastasis-free survival across all subtypes. YB-1 is also secreted by different cell types and may act as an extracellular mitogen; however the pathological implications of the secreted form of YB-1 (sYB-1) are unknown. Our purpose was to retrospectively evaluate the association between YB-1 measured by ELISA in serum and disease characteristics and outcomes in patients with BC and bone metastases (BM). In our cohort, sYB-1 was detected in the serum of 22 (50%) patients, and was associated with the presence of extra-bone metastases (p=0.044). Positive sYB-1 was also associated with faster bone disease progression (HR 3.1, 95% CI 1.09-8.95, P=0.033), but no significant differences were observed concerning OS, and time to development of skeletal-related events. Moreover, patients with positive sYB-1 also had higher levels of IL-6, a known osteoclastogenic inducer. Therefore, detection of sYB-1 in patients with BC and BM may indicate a higher tumor burden, in bone and extra-bone locations, and is a biomarker of faster bone disease progression.	2017
28187031	X-Ray of Excised Cancerous Breast Tissue Does Not Affect Clinical Biomarker Expression.	College of American Pathologists (CAP) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology have emphasized the need to reduce preanalytic variables for evaluating predictive biomarker expression in breast cancer. Postoperative x-ray of excised breast tissue is commonplace, yet is a variable that has not been investigated previously. We asked whether such radiation affects expression of relevant biomarkers.	A previous study found that human breast cancers grown in mice demonstrate the same immunohistochemical and molecular profiles as the original tumors. Thirteen patient-derived xenografts were harvested fresh and divided for specimen radiography and a matched nonirradiated control, while following CAP/ASCO guidelines for cold ischemia time and fixation. Samples were processed in a tissue microarray for immunohistochemistry. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), p53, and Ki67 staining was evaluated using an optimized scoring algorithm performed on digitally scanned slides. Samples were also scored manually by a blinded pathologist using the H-score method, and HER2 by the CAP/ASCO 2013 protocol. Histologic scores were compared by analysis of variance.	There was no significant difference in quantity or intensity of staining between irradiated and nonirradiated samples for estrogen receptor (P=0.28), p53 (P=0.96), and Ki67 (P=0.94). A small but statistically significant difference was observed for PR (P=0.0058). HER2 staining was similarly unchanged in the 1 tumor exhibiting 3+ staining.	Our study demonstrates that x-ray of breast carcinomas does not significantly affect the expression of predictive biomarkers, with the exception of PR for unclear reasons. It also highlights the utility of the patient-derived xenograft model for biomarker studies.	2018
28165479	Whole-genome single-cell copy number profiling from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples.	A substantial proportion of tumors consist of genotypically distinct subpopulations of cancer cells. This intratumor genetic heterogeneity poses a substantial challenge for the implementation of precision medicine. Single-cell genomics constitutes a powerful approach to resolve complex mixtures of cancer cells by tracing cell lineages and discovering cryptic genetic variations that would otherwise be obscured in tumor bulk analyses. Because of the chemical alterations that result from formalin fixation, single-cell genomic approaches have largely remained limited to fresh or rapidly frozen specimens. Here we describe the development and validation of a robust and accurate methodology to perform whole-genome copy-number profiling of single nuclei obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded clinical tumor samples. We applied the single-cell sequencing approach described here to study the progression from in situ to invasive breast cancer, which revealed that ductal carcinomas in situ show intratumor genetic heterogeneity at diagnosis and that these lesions may progress to invasive breast cancer through a variety of evolutionary processes.	2017
28134654	Does expecting more pain make it more intense? Factors associated with the first week pain trajectories after breast cancer surgery.	The aim of this study was to identify clinical risk factors for unfavorable pain trajectories after breast cancer surgery, to better understand the association between pain expectation, psychological distress, and acute postoperative pain. This prospective study included 563 women treated for breast cancer. Psychological data included questionnaires for depressive symptoms and anxiety. Experimental pain tests for heat and cold were performed before surgery. The amount of oxycodone needed for satisfactory pain relief after surgery was recorded. Pain intensity in the area of operation before surgery and during the first postoperative week and expected intensity of postoperative pain were recorded using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS 0-10). Pain trajectories were formed to describe both initial intensity (the intercept) and the direction of the pain path (the slope). Factors associated with higher initial pain intensity (the intercept) were the amount of oxycodone needed for adequate analgesia, psychological distress, type of axillary surgery, preoperative pain in the area of the operation, and expectation of postoperative pain. The higher the pain initially was, the faster it resolved over the week. Expectation of severe postoperative pain was associated with higher scores of both experimental and clinical pain intensity and psychological factors. The results confirm that acute pain after breast cancer surgery is a multidimensional phenomenon. Psychological distress, pain expectation, and the patients' report of preoperative pain in the area to be operated should be recognized before surgery. Patients having axillary clearance need more efficient analgesic approaches.	2017
28129687	A Case of Anaphylaxis to Patent Blue in a Patient with Sentinel Lymph Node Excision.	In medicine, patent blue violet (PBV) is utilized for staining lymphatic vessels in sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery. Moreover, PBV (also called E131) is used as food additive. We report on a 51-year-old non-atopic female with early breast cancer, who was scheduled for SLN excision and experienced an intra-operative anaphylactic reaction. In diagnostics the skin prick test (SPT) was positive to PBV. Hypersensitivity reactions to PBV can arise after the first exposure in surgery as sensitization may arise from either PBV (E131) in foods (i.e. in sweets or blue curacao) or from other structurally closely related triarylmethane dyes in objects of everyday life like textiles, detergents, paints, cold remedies and cosmetics. This article supports the necessity of an increased awareness of the possibility of anaphylactic reactions to PBV during SLN surgery, even if the patient never had contact to PBV before.	2016
28108330	Pleiotropic responses to methionine restriction.	Methionine restriction (MR) extends lifespan across different species. The main responses of rodent models to MR are well-documented in adipose tissue (AT) and liver, which have reduced mass and improved insulin sensitivity, respectively. Recently, molecular mechanisms that improve healthspan have been identified in both organs during MR. In fat, MR induced a futile lipid cycle concomitant with beige AT accumulation, producing elevated energy expenditure. In liver, MR upregulated fibroblast growth factor 21 and improved glucose metabolism in aged mice and in response to a high-fat diet. Furthermore, MR also reduces mitochondrial oxidative stress in various organs such as liver, heart, kidneys, and brain. Other effects of MR have also been reported in such areas as cardiac function in response to hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy), identification of molecular mechanisms in bone development, and enhanced epithelial tight junction. In addition, rodent models of cancer responded positively to MR, as has been reported in colon, prostate, and breast cancer studies. The beneficial effects of MR have also been documented in a number of invertebrate model organisms, including yeast, nematodes, and fruit flies. MR not only promotes extended longevity in these organisms, but in the case of yeast has also been shown to improve stress tolerance. In addition, expression analyses of yeast and Drosophila undergoing MR have identified multiple candidate mediators of the beneficial effects of MR in these models. In this review, we emphasize other in vivo effects of MR such as in cardiovascular function, bone development, epithelial tight junction, and cancer. We also discuss the effects of MR in invertebrates.	2017
28103946	EPCR promotes breast cancer progression by altering SPOCK1/testican 1-mediated 3D growth.	Activated protein C/endothelial protein C receptor (APC/EPCR) axis is physiologically involved in anticoagulant and cytoprotective activities in endothelial cells. Emerging evidence indicates that EPCR also plays a role in breast stemness and human tumorigenesis. Yet, its contribution to breast cancer progression and metastasis has not been elucidated.	Transcriptomic status of EPCR was examined in a cohort of 286 breast cancer patients. Cell growth kinetics was evaluated in control and EPCR and SPARC/osteonectin, Cwcv, and kazal-like domains proteoglycan (SPOCK1/testican 1) silenced breast cancer cells in 2D, 3D, and in co-culture conditions. Orthotopic tumor growth and lung and osseous metastases were evaluated in several human and murine xenograft breast cancer models. Tumor-stroma interactions were further studied in vivo by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. An EPCR-induced gene signature was identified by microarray analysis.	Analysis of a cohort of breast cancer patients revealed an association of high EPCR levels with adverse clinical outcome. Interestingly, EPCR knockdown did not affect cell growth kinetics in 2D but significantly reduced cell growth in 3D cultures. Using several human and murine xenograft breast cancer models, we showed that EPCR silencing reduced primary tumor growth and secondary outgrowths at metastatic sites, including the skeleton and the lungs. Interestingly, these effects were independent of APC ligand stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic analysis of EPCR-silenced tumors unveiled an effect mediated by matricellular secreted proteoglycan SPOCK1/testican 1. Interestingly, SPOCK1 silencing suppressed in vitro 3D growth. Moreover, SPOCK1 ablation severely decreased orthotopic tumor growth and reduced bone metastatic osteolytic tumors. High SPOCK1 levels were also associated with poor clinical outcome in a subset breast cancer patients. Our results suggest that EPCR through SPOCK1 confers a cell growth advantage in 3D promoting breast tumorigenesis and metastasis.	EPCR represents a clinically relevant factor associated with poor outcome and a novel vulnerability to develop combination therapies for breast cancer patients.	2017
28062556	The Cellular Origin and Evolution of Breast Cancer.	In this review, we will discuss how the cell of origin may modulate breast cancer intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) as well as the role of ITH in the evolution of cancer. The clonal evolution and the cancer stem cell (CSC) models, as well as a model that integrates clonal evolution with a CSC hierarchy, have all been proposed to explain the development of ITH. The extent of ITH correlates with clinical outcome and reflects the cellular complexity and dynamics within a tumor. A unique subtype of breast cancer, the claudin-low subtype that is highly resistant to chemotherapy and most closely resembles mammary epithelial stem cells, will be discussed. Furthermore, we will review how the interactions among various tumor cells, some with distinct mutations, may impact breast cancer treatment. Finally, novel technologies that may help advance our understanding of ITH and lead to improvements in the design of new treatments also will be discussed.	2017
28062533	BET Bromodomain Proteins as Cancer Therapeutic Targets.	Epigenetic regulators are emerging therapeutic targets in a wide variety of human cancers. BET bromodomain proteins have been identified as key regulators of oncogenic transcription factors including MYC; therefore, their inhibition might provide a way to block these "undruggable" targets. Several BET bromodomain inhibitors are in clinical development with promising preliminary findings. However, tumors acquire resistance to these agents in several different ways. In this review, we summarize the role that BET bromodomain proteins play in tumorigenesis as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying therapeutic responses and resistance to their inhibition with emphasis on BRD4 and breast cancer.	2016
28057846	Beyond the Oncogene Revolution: Four New Ways to Combat Cancer.	It has become clear that tumorigenesis results from much more than just the activation of an oncogene and/or the inactivation of a tumor-suppressor gene, and that the cancer cell genome contains many more alterations than can be specifically targeted at once. This observation has led our group to a search for alternative ways to kill cancer cells (while sparing normal cells) by focusing on properties unique to the former. We have identified four approaches with the potential to generate new anticancer therapies: combatting the tactics by which cancers evade antitumor immune responses, targeting metabolic adaptations that tumor cells use to survive conditions that would kill normal cells, manipulating a cancer cell's response to excessive oxidative stress, and exploiting aneuploidy. This review describes our progress to date on these fronts.	2016
28057845	Targeting the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition: The Case for Differentiation-Based Therapy.	Although important strides have been made in targeted therapy for certain leukemias and subtypes of breast cancer, the standard of care for most carcinomas still involves chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery, or a combination of these. Two processes serve as obstacles to the successful treatment of carcinomas. First, a majority of deaths from these types of cancers occurs as a result of distant metastases and not the primary tumors themselves. Second, subsets of cells that are able to survive conventional therapy drive the aggressive relapse of the tumors, often in forms that are resistant to treatment. A frequently observed feature of malignant carcinomas is the loss of epithelial traits and the gain of certain mesenchymal ones that are programmed by the cell-biological program termed the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The EMT program can confer (i) an ability to disseminate, (ii) an ability to become stem-like tumor-initiating cells, (iii) an ability to found new tumor colonies at distant anatomical sites, and (iv) an elevated resistance to therapy. These multiple powers of the EMT program explain why it has become an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Recent work has revealed the variable nature of the EMT, with multiple versions of the program being observed depending on the tissue context and the stage of tumor progression. In this review, we attempt to crystallize emerging concepts in the research on EMT and stemness and discuss the benefits of using a differentiation-based therapeutic strategy for the eradication of stem-like populations that have adopted various versions of the EMT program.	2016
30234242	Local Skin Cooling as an Aid to the Management of Patients with Breast Cancer Related Lymphedema and Fibrosis of the Arm or Breast.	Based on preliminary observations that topical cooling appeared to soften lymphedematous and fibrotic tissue, our goal was to systematically and quantitatively evaluate this effect. For this purpose, topical cooling was used as part of treatment of lymphedematous and fibrotic skin of women with breast cancer related lymphedema (BCRL) and localized fibrosis. Skin tissue hardness was assessed via the force required to indent skin to 4 mm (F4.0) and 1.3 mm (F1.3) and skin water was assessed by measurements of tissue dielectric constant (TDC). Measurements were done before cooling, after cooling, and after a single treatment session in 20 women with arm involvement and in 12 women with breast involvement. Pre-cooled arm and breast skin temperatures (mean ± SD) of 32.4 ± 1.4°C and 33.8 ± 1.0°C were reduced to 23.7 ± 2.0°C and 24.7 ± 1.6°C respectively via application of cold washcloths. Cooling was associated with a significant (p<0.001) decrease in F4.0 and F1.3 at arm and breast sites. At arm sites, force reductions ranged from 24% to 28% depending on indentation depth. Although the precise mechanism linking cooling to softening is as yet not fully understood, the fact that tissue is softened carries with it many potential benefits to patient and therapist. The near immediate tissue softening is associated with less pressure on underlying nerve endings and less input to sensory nerves thereby interrupting the pain cycle resulting in rapid pain relief. The rapidly softened tissue and decreased perception of pain offers the patient hope and encouragement in their therapeutic journey to reclaiming functional use of their affected body. Further, because softer tissue becomes more pliable, myofascial lengthening, scar tissue releasing, and other aspects of treatment are easier to perform thereby reducing treatment time and effort while achieving improved functional mobility.	2017
27900363	Integration of genomics and histology revises diagnosis and enables effective therapy of refractory cancer of unknown primary with PDL1 amplification.	Identification of the tissue of origin in cancer of unknown primary (CUP) poses a diagnostic challenge and is critical for directing site-specific therapy. Currently, clinical decision-making in patients with CUP primarily relies on histopathology and clinical features. Comprehensive molecular profiling has the potential to contribute to diagnostic categorization and, most importantly, guide CUP therapy through identification of actionable lesions. We here report the case of an advanced-stage malignancy initially mimicking poorly differentiated soft-tissue sarcoma that did not respond to multiagent chemotherapy. Molecular profiling within a clinical whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing program revealed a heterozygous, highly amplified KRAS G12S mutation, compound-heterozygous TP53 mutation/deletion, high mutational load, and focal high-level amplification of Chromosomes 9p (including PDL1 [CD274] and JAK2) and 10p (including GATA3). Integrated analysis of molecular data and histopathology provided a rationale for immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy with pembrolizumab, which resulted in rapid clinical improvement and a lasting partial remission. Histopathological analyses ruled out sarcoma and established the diagnosis of a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Although neither histopathology nor molecular data were able to pinpoint the tissue of origin, our analyses established several differential diagnoses including triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We analyzed 157 TNBC samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas, revealing PDL1 copy number gains coinciding with excessive PDL1 mRNA expression in 24% of cases. Collectively, these results illustrate the impact of multidimensional tumor profiling in cases with nondescript histology and immunophenotype, show the predictive potential of PDL1 amplification for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and suggest a targeted therapeutic strategy in Chromosome 9p24.1/PDL1-amplified cancers.	2016
27900359	Homozygous inactivation of CHEK2 is linked to a familial case of multiple primary lung cancer with accompanying cancers in other organs.	In clinical practice, there are a number of cancer patients with clear family histories, but the patients lack mutations in known familial cancer syndrome genes. Recent advances in genomic technologies have enhanced the possibility of identifying causative genes in such cases. Two siblings, an elder sister and a younger brother, were found to have multiple primary lung cancers at the age of 60. The former subsequently developed breast cancer and had a history of uterine myoma. The latter had initially developed prostate cancer at the age of 59 and had a history of colon cancer. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping revealed that ∼10% of the genomes were homozygous in both patients. Exome sequencing revealed nonsynonymous mutations in five genes in the runs of homozygosity: CHEK2, FCGRT, INPP5J, MYO18B, and SFI1. Evolutionary conservation of primary protein structures suggested the functional importance of the CHEK2 mutation, p.R474C. This mutation altered the tertiary structure of CHK2 by disrupting the salt bridge between p.R474 and p.E394. No such structural changes were observed with the other mutated genes. Subsequent cell-based transfection analysis revealed that CHK2 p.R474C was unstable and scarcely activated. We concluded that the homozygous CHEK2 variant was contributory in this case of familial cancer. Although homozygous inactivation of CHEK2 in mice led to cancers in multiple organs, accumulation of additional human cases is needed to establish its pathogenic role in humans.	2016
27891244	The effectiveness of regional cooling for paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy.	There are currently no promising therapies available to treat or prevent peripheral neuropathy (PN) induced by anticancer drugs in a cumulative dose-dependent manner. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of regional cooling of hands and feet in preventing paclitaxel (PTX)-induced PN.	Patients with gynecologic cancer who received a tri-weekly cycle of chemotherapy including PTX at doses of 150-175 mg/m2 were included in this study. Regional cooling was performed by covering patient hands and feet with cold insulators during PTX administration (regional cooling group). The primary end-point was ≥grade 2 PN evaluated by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. The secondary end-points were the frequency of PN therapeutic drug use, PTX dose reduction due to PN, and adverse events due to regional cooling. The efficacy of regional cooling was compared with data retrospectively extracted from the medical records of patients who did not receive regional cooling (control group). All end-points were evaluated for up to six cycles.	There were 40 and 142 patients in the regional cooling and control groups, respectively. As a primary end-point, incidences of ≥grade 2 PN in the fourth to sixth cycles were significantly lower than that in the cooling group (5.0-9.1 % vs. 19.8-31.6 %, p < 0.05 after the fourth cycle and p < 0.01 after the fifth cycle). Among secondary end-points, neither the use of PN therapeutic drugs nor the PTX dose reduction due to PN were significantly lower in the cooling group than in the control group (27.5 vs. 36.6 %, p = 0.378 and 5.0 vs. 3.5 %, p = 0.645, respectively). There were no serious regional cooling-associated adverse events such as frostbite.	Regional cooling of hands and feet during PTX administration might have good effectiveness and tolerability, suggesting this approach as a potentially effective supportive care to prevent PTX-induced PN.	The trial approval number in the institution; H25-26. Registered 5 June 2014.	2016
27837912	Cold-inducible RNA binding protein in mouse mammary gland development.	RNA binding proteins (RBPs) regulate gene expression by controlling mRNA export, translation, and stability. When altered, some RBPs allow cancer cells to grow, survive, and metastasize. Cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRP) is overexpressed in a subset of breast cancers, induces proliferation in breast cancer cell lines, and inhibits apoptosis. Although studies have begun to examine the role of CIRP in breast and other cancers, its role in normal breast development has not been assessed. We generated a transgenic mouse model overexpressing human CIRP in the mammary epithelium to ask if it plays a role in mammary gland development. Effects of CIRP overexpression on mammary gland morphology, cell proliferation, and apoptosis were studied from puberty through pregnancy, lactation and weaning. There were no gross effects on mammary gland morphology as shown by whole mounts. Immunohistochemistry for the proliferation marker Ki67 showed decreased proliferation during the lactational switch (the transition from pregnancy to lactation) in mammary glands from CIRP transgenic mice. Two markers of apoptosis showed that the transgene did not affect apoptosis during mammary gland involution. These results suggest a potential in vivo function in suppressing proliferation during a specific developmental transition.	2016
27815543	Genetic Dissection of Cancer Development, Therapy Response, and Resistance in Mouse Models of Breast Cancer.	The cancer genomics revolution has rapidly expanded the inventory of somatic mutations characterizing human malignancies, highlighting a previously underappreciated extent of molecular variability between and within patients. Also in breast cancer, the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women, this heterogeneity complicates the understanding of the stepwise sequence of pathogenic events and the design of effective and long-lasting target therapies. To disentangle this complexity and pinpoint which molecular perturbations are crucial to hijack the cellular machinery and lead to tumorigenesis and drug resistance, functional studies are needed in model systems that faithfully and comprehensively recapitulate all the salient aspects of their cognate human counterparts. Mouse models of breast cancer have been instrumental for the study of tumor initiation and drug response but also involve cost and time limitations that represent serious bottlenecks in translational research. To keep pace with the overwhelming amount of hypotheses that warrant in vivo testing, continuous refinement of current breast cancer models and implementation of new technologies is crucial. In this review, we summarize the current state of the art in modeling human breast cancer in mice, and we put forward our vision for future developments.	2016
27815305	TP53 Mutations in Breast and Ovarian Cancer.	Breast and ovarian cancers are the second and fifth leading causes of cancer deaths among women. Both breast and ovarian cancers are highly heterogeneous and are presented with diverse morphology, natural history, and response to therapy. In recent years, international efforts have led to extensive molecular characterization of both breast and ovarian tumors and identified biologically and clinically relevant subtypes of the diseases based on these molecular features. The role of TP53 in tumor initiation and progression is context dependent, and abrogation of the TP53 pathway seems to be essential for the development of basal-like breast cancers and high-grade serous ovarian cancers. These subtypes of breast and ovarian cancer show several genomic similarities including high frequency of TP53 mutation, which seems to be an early, initiating, and driving alteration in these cancer subtypes.	2017
27503997	Somatic TP53 Mutations in the Era of Genome Sequencing.	Amid the complexity of genetic alterations in human cancer, TP53 mutation appears as an almost invariant component, representing by far the most frequent genetic alteration overall. Compared with previous targeted sequencing studies, recent integrated genomics studies offer a less biased view of TP53 mutation patterns, revealing that >20% of mutations occur outside the DNA-binding domain. Among the 12 mutations representing each at least 1% of all mutations, five occur at residues directly involved in specific DNA binding, four affect the tertiary fold of the DNA-binding domain, and three are nonsense mutations, two of them in the carboxyl terminus. Significant mutations also occur in introns, affecting alternative splicing events or generating rearrangements (e.g., in intron 1 in sporadic osteosarcoma). In aggressive cancers, mutation is so common that it may not have prognostic value (all these cancers have impaired p53 function caused by mutation or by other mechanisms). In several other cancers, however, mutation makes a clear difference for prognostication, as, for example, in HER2-enriched breast cancers and in lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations. Thus, the clinical significance of TP53 mutation is dependent on tumor subtype and context. Understanding the clinical impact of mutation will require integrating mutation-specific information (type, frequency, and predicted impact) with data on haplotypes and on loss of heterozygosity.	2016
27390161	Selective Imaging of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 Using 89Zr-Labeled Single-Chain VEGF Mutants.	Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) acts via 2 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, that play important and distinct roles in tumor biology. We reasoned that selective imaging of these receptors could provide unique information for diagnostics and for monitoring and optimizing responses to anticancer therapy, including antiangiogenic therapy. Herein, we report the development of 2 first-in-class 89Zr-labeled PET tracers that enable the selective imaging of VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2.	Functionally active mutants of scVEGF (an engineered single-chain version of pan-receptor VEGF-A with an N-terminal cysteine-containing tag for site-specific conjugation), named scVR1 and scVR2 with enhanced affinity to, respectively, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, were constructed. Parental scVEGF and its receptor-specific mutants were site-specifically derivatized with the 89Zr chelator desferroxamine B via a 3.4-kDa PEG linker. 89Zr labeling of the desferroxamine B conjugates furnished scV/Zr, scVR1/Zr, and scVR2/Zr tracers with high radiochemical yield (>87%), high specific activity (≥9.8 MBq/nmol), and purity (>99%). Tracers were tested in an orthotopic breast cancer model using 4T1luc-bearing syngeneic BALB/c mice. For testing tracer specificity, tracers were coinjected with an excess of cold proteins of the same or opposite receptor specificity or pan-receptor scVEGF. PET imaging, biodistribution, and dosimetry studies in mice, as well as immunohistochemical analysis of harvested tumors, were performed.	All tracers rapidly accumulated in orthotopic 4T1luc tumors, allowing for the successful PET imaging of the tumors as early as 2 h after injection. Blocking experiments with an excess of pan-receptor or receptor-specific cold proteins indicated that more than 80% of tracer tumor uptake is VEGFR-mediated, whereas uptake in all major organs is not affected by blocking within the margin of error. Critically, blocking experiments indicated that VEGFR-mediated tumor uptake of scVR1/Zr and scVR2/Zr was mediated exclusively by the corresponding receptor, VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2, respectively. In contrast, uptake of pan-receptor scV/Zr was mediated by both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 at an approximately 2:1 ratio.	First-in-class selective PET tracers for imaging VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 were constructed and successfully validated in an orthotopic murine tumor model.	2016
27798263	Cancer cells induce metastasis-supporting neutrophil extracellular DNA traps.	Neutrophils, the most abundant type of leukocytes in blood, can form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These are pathogen-trapping structures generated by expulsion of the neutrophil's DNA with associated proteolytic enzymes. NETs produced by infection can promote cancer metastasis. We show that metastatic breast cancer cells can induce neutrophils to form metastasis-supporting NETs in the absence of infection. Using intravital imaging, we observed NET-like structures around metastatic 4T1 cancer cells that had reached the lungs of mice. We also found NETs in clinical samples of triple-negative human breast cancer. The formation of NETs stimulated the invasion and migration of breast cancer cells in vitro. Inhibiting NET formation or digesting NETs with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) blocked these processes. Treatment with NET-digesting, DNase I-coated nanoparticles markedly reduced lung metastases in mice. Our data suggest that induction of NETs by cancer cells is a previously unidentified metastasis-promoting tumor-host interaction and a potential therapeutic target.	2016
30173473	[NONSURGICAL ABLATION THERAPY FOR SMALL BREAST CARCINOMAS].	Breast-conserving therapy was introduced in Japan in the 1980s as a local treatment for early-stage disease used under cautiously developed criteria. Its indications have gradually been expanded by, for example, the addition of concomitant preoperative chemotherapy. More than half of breast cancer patients currently benefit from this treatment. Recently, nonsurgical ablative therapies have been tested as a definitive conservative treatment. Clinical studies on high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and cryoablation began in 2004 and 2006, respectively. Phase I and phase II multicenter clinical trials of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) as a treatment for early-stage breast cancer were started in 2006 under the Evaluation System of Investigational Medical Care. A prospective phase III trial was started in 2013 under the Advanced Medical Service System. Data on nonsurgical ablative therapies including RFA, cryoablation, and HIFU are steadily accumulating. We believe that these therapies can replace lumpectomy, the current standard treatment for early breast cancer, in the near future.	2016
27793035	Performance of multiplicom's BRCA MASTR Dx kit on the detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in fresh frozen ovarian and breast tumor samples.	Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled new approaches for detection of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes responsible for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The search for germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes is of importance with respect to oncogenetic and surgical (bilateral mastectomy, ovariectomy) counselling. Testing tumor material for BRCA mutations is of increasing importance for therapeutic decision making as the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, olaparib, is now available to treat patients with specific forms of ovarian cancer and BRCA mutations. Molecular genetics laboratories should develop reliable and sensitive techniques for the complete analysis of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. This is a challenge due to the size of the coding sequence of the BRCA1/2 genes, the absence of hot spot mutations, and particularly by the lower DNA quality obtained from Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue. As a result, a number of analyses are uninterpretable and do not always provide a result to the clinician, limiting the optimal therapeutic management of patients. The availability of Fresh Frozen Tissue (FFT) for some laboratories and the excellent quality of the DNA extracted from it offers an alternative. For this reason, we evaluated Multiplicom's BRCA MASTR Dx assay on a set of 97 FFT derived DNA samples, in combination with the MID for Illumina MiSeq for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation detection. We obtained interpretable NGS results for all tested samples and showed > 99,7% sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.	2016
27761070	Phytochemicals and Cytotoxicity of Launaea procumbens on Human Cancer Cell Lines.	The plant Launaea procumbens belongs to the family Asteraceae and traditionally used in the treatment rheumatism, kidney, liver dysfunctions and eye diseases. In the present study Phytochemical analysis and fractions of methanolic extract of L. procumbens leaves were tested in vitro for their cytotoxicity.	Phytochemical analysis and cytotoxic activity of methanolic extract and fractions of Launaea procumbens against four cancer cell lines K562, HeLa, MIA-Pa-Ca-2 and MCF-2 by SRB assay.	Powdered leaves of Launaea procumbens were extracted sequentially with hexane, ethyl acetate, butanol and water by cold extraction. Phytochemical analysis and cytotoxicity assay were carried out for these fractions using SRB assay against four human cancer cell lines, namely leukemia (K562), cervix (HeLa), pancreatic (MIA-Pa-Ca-2) and breast (MCF-7).	Ethyl acetate extract exerts potent cytotoxicity against human leukemia (K562), cervix (HeLa) and breast (MCF-7) cell lines IC50 value of 25.30±0.50, 19.80±0.10 and 36.90±4.90 μg/ml respectively. Moderately cytotoxic effect found in hexane extract IC50 value of 41±8 and 48.20±0.50 μg/ml against leukemia (K562), and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell line respectively. The Chemical composition analyzed by GC-MS showed considerable differences in solvent fractions of Launaea procumbens.	This study revealed the cytotoxic potential of ethyl acetate and hexane fractions of L. procumbens leaves on different cancer cell lines.	Ethyl acetate and Hexane fractions of Launaea procumbens plant exhibit cytotoxicity. Among the different fractions Ethyl acetate showed relatively higher cytotoxicity.Ethyl acetate found more cytotoxic against leukemia (K 562), cervix (HeLa) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell lines. Moderete cytotoxicity found in hexane fraction against leukemia (K 562) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cell line.GC-MS results showed L. procumbens is a rich source of 1-H- pyrazole, 1-H-imidazole, β -amyrin, α -amyrin and lupeol. These compounds may be attributed for the cytotoxic activity. Abbreviations used: SRB: Sulforhodamine B assay, MW: Molecular weight.	2016
27748977	Enhancing cold atmospheric plasma treatment of cancer cells by static magnetic field.	It has been reported since late 1970 that magnetic field interacts strongly with biological systems. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has also been widely studied over the past few decades in physics, biology, and medicine. In this study, we propose a novel idea to combine static magnetic field (SMF) with CAP as a tool for cancer therapy. Breast cancer cells and wild type fibroblasts were cultured in 96-well plates and treated by CAP with or without SMF. Breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 showed a significant decrease in viability after direct plasma treatment with SMF (compared to only plasma treatment). In addition, cancer cells treated by the CAP-SMF-activated medium (indirect treatment) also showed viability decrease but was slightly weaker than the direct plasma-SMF treatment. By integrating the use of SMF and CAP, we were able to discover their advantages that have yet to be utilized. Bioelectromagnetics. 38:53-62, 2017. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	2017
27730528	Body mass index and menopausal disorders during menopause affect vasomotor symptoms of postmenopausal Japanese breast cancer patients treated with anastrozole: a prospective multicenter cohort study of patient-reported outcomes.	Adverse events related to endocrine therapies have a major impact not only on patients' quality of life but also on treatment discontinuation. Although vasomotor symptoms induced by aromatase inhibitors are frequently recognized, risk factors, especially for Japanese women, are not well reported. To identify risk factors for vasomotor symptoms of Japanese breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant anastrozole, we conducted a prospective cohort study based on patient-reported outcomes (PROs).	For this prospective cohort study (SAVS-JP, UMIN000002455), 391 postmenopausal Japanese estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients who were treated with adjuvant anastrozole were recruited from 28 centers. The PRO assessment was obtained from a self-reported questionnaire at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months between August 2009 and April 2012. Vasomotor symptoms, comprising hot flashes, night sweats, and cold sweats, were categorized into four grades (none, Grade 1: mild, Grade 2: moderate, Grade 3: severe). Pre-existing symptoms were only included if they had become worse than at baseline.	Hot flashes, night sweats, and cold sweats at baseline were reported by 20.5, 15.1, and 8.2 % of the patients, respectively, and new appearance or worsening of symptoms in comparison with baseline by 38.4, 29.3, and 28.7 %, respectively. About 80 % of newly occurring symptoms were Grade 1, and less than 5 % were Grade 3. Vasomotor symptoms were reported by 201 out of 362 patients (55.5 %) during the first year and the mean time to onset was 5.6 months. Patients with vasomotor symptoms were significantly younger (mean 62.8 years, range 38-86 vs 64.7 years, range 37-84; p = 0.02), had higher body mass index (BMI) (23.4 kg/m2, range 15.8-39.9 vs 22.4 kg/m2, range 15.8-34.9; p = 0.01), had vasomotor symptoms sooner after menopause (12.4 years, range 0-51 vs 15.1 years, range 1-37; p = 0.002), and had more menopausal disorders during menopause (63.3 vs 36.7 %; p = 0.002). Multivariate analysis showed that BMI [odds ratio (OR) 1.09 per unit of increase, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.16; p = 0.009] and experiencing menopausal disorders (OR 2.11, 95 % CI 1.35-3.30; p = 0.001) were significantly associated with vasomotor symptoms.	High BMI and experiencing menopausal disorders at menopause were found to be significantly associated with the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms. These findings are expected to prove useful for the management of postmenopausal Japanese women treated with aromatase inhibitors.	2017
27729800	Combination of cold atmospheric plasma and iron nanoparticles in breast cancer: gene expression and apoptosis study.	Current cancer treatments have unexpected side effects of which the death of normal cells is one. In some cancers, iron nanoparticles (NPs) can be subjected to diagnosis and passive targeting treatment. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has a proven induction of selective cell death ability. In this study, we have attempted to analyze the synergy between CAP and iron NPs in human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7).	In vitro cytotoxicity of CAP treatment and NPs in cells measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and cell death was shown by 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and annexin V staining. Fluctuations in BAX and BCL-2 gene expression were investigated by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction.	MTT assay results showed that combination of plasma and iron NPs decreased the viability of cancer cells significantly (P<0.05). Real-time analysis showed that the combination therapy induced shifting the BAX/BCL-2 ratio in favor of apoptosis.	Our data indicate that synergy between CAP and iron NPs can be applied in breast cancer treatment selectively.	2016
27681436	Mammary Tumor-Associated RNAs Impact Tumor Cell Proliferation, Invasion, and Migration.	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) represent the largest and most diverse class of non-coding RNAs, comprising almost 16,000 currently annotated transcripts in human and 10,000 in mouse. Here, we investigated the role of lncRNAs in mammary tumors by performing RNA-seq on tumor sections and organoids derived from MMTV-PyMT and MMTV-Neu-NDL mice. We identified several hundred lncRNAs that were overexpressed compared to normal mammary epithelium. Among these potentially oncogenic lncRNAs we prioritized a subset as Mammary Tumor Associated RNAs (MaTARs) and determined their human counterparts, hMaTARs. To functionally validate the role of MaTARs, we performed antisense knockdown and observed reduced cell proliferation, invasion, and/or organoid branching in a cancer-specific context. Assessing the expression of hMaTARs in human breast tumors revealed that 19 hMaTARs are significantly upregulated and many of these correlate with breast cancer subtype and/or hormone receptor status, indicating potential clinical relevance.	2016
27516981	Ctotoxic and apoptogenic effects of Perovskia abrotanoides flower extract on MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines.	Perovskia abrotanoides Karel, belongs to the family Lamiaceae and grows wild alongside the mountainous roads inarid and cold climate of Northern Iran. The anti-tumor activity of P. abrotanoides root extract has been shown previously. This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of flower extract of P. abrotanoides on MCF-7 and Hela cell lines.	Cells were cultured in DMEM medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 µg/ml streptomycin and incubated with different concentrations of plant extracts. Cell viability was quantified by MTT assay. Apoptotic cells were determined using propidium iodide (PI) staining of DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak).	P. abrotanoides extract inhibited the growth of malignant cells in a time and dose-dependent manner and 1000 µg/ml of extract following 48h of incubation was the most cytotoxic dose against Hela cell in comparison with other doses; however, in MCF-7 cells,1000 and 500 µg/ml PA induced toxicity at all time points but with different features.. Analysis of flowcytometry histogram of treated cells compared with control cells indicated that the cytotoxic effect is partly due toapoptosis induction.	Hydro-alcoholic extract of P. abrotanoides flowers inhibits the growth of MCF-7 and HeLa cell lines, partly via inducing apoptosis. Their inhibitory effect was increased in a time and dose-dependent manner, especially in MCF7 cells. However, further studies are needed to reveal the mechanisms of P. abrotanoides extract-induced cell death.
27507282	Multimodal US-gamma imaging using collaborative robotics for cancer staging biopsies.	The staging of female breast cancer requires detailed information about the level of cancer spread through the lymphatic system. Common practice to obtain this information for patients with early-stage cancer is sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, where LNs are radioactively identified for surgical removal and subsequent histological analysis. Punch needle biopsy is a less invasive approach but suffers from the lack of combined anatomical and nuclear information. We present and evaluate a system that introduces live collaborative robotic 2D gamma imaging in addition to live 2D ultrasound to identify SLNs in the surrounding anatomy.	The system consists of a robotic arm equipped with both a gamma camera and a stereoscopic tracking system that monitors the position of an ultrasound probe operated by the physician. The arm cooperatively places the gamma camera parallel to the ultrasound imaging plane to provide live multimodal visualization and guidance. We validate the system by evaluating the target registration errors between fused nuclear and US image data in a phantom consisting of two spheres, one of which is filled with radioactivity. Medical experts perform punch biopsies on agar-gelatine phantoms with complex configurations of hot and cold lesions to provide a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the system.	The average point registration error for the overlay is [Formula: see text] mm. The time of the entire procedure was reduced by 36 %, with 80v of the biopsies being successful. The users' feedback was very positive, and the system was deemed to be very intuitive, with handling similar to classic US-guided needle biopsy.	We present and evaluate the first medical collaborative robotic imaging system. Feedback from potential users for SLN punch needle biopsy is encouraging. Ongoing work investigates the clinical feasibility with more complex and realistic phantoms.	2016
27445062	Epigenetic silencing of miR-19a-3p by cold atmospheric plasma contributes to proliferation inhibition of the MCF-7 breast cancer cell.	Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has been proposed as a useful cancer treatment option after showing higher induction of cell death in cancer cells than in normal cells. Although a few studies have contributed to elucidating the molecular mechanism by which CAP differentially inhibits cancer cell proliferation, no results are yet to be reported related to microRNA (miR). In this study, miR-19a-3p (miR-19a) was identified as a mediator of the cell proliferation-inhibitory effect of CAP in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell. CAP treatment of MCF-7 induced hypermethylation at the promoter CpG sites and downregulation of miR-19a, which was known as an oncomiR. The overexpression of miR-19a in MCF-7 increased cell proliferation, and CAP deteriorated the effect. The target genes of miR-19a, such as ABCA1 and PTEN, that had been suppressed by miR recovered their expression through CAP treatment. In addition, an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species that is produced by CAP suppressed the effect of CAP on cell proliferation. Taken together, the present study, to the best of authors' knowledge, is the first to identify the involvement of a miR, which is dysregulated by the CAP and results in the anti-proliferation effect of CAP on cancer cells.	2016
27338742	The Growth Inhibitory Potential and Antimetastatic Effect of Camel Urine on Breast Cancer Cells In Vitro and In Vivo.	Although it may sound unpleasant, camel urine has been consumed extensively for years in the Middle East as it is believed to be able to treat a wide range of diseases such as fever, cold, or even cancer. People usually take it by mixing small drops with camel milk or take it directly. The project aims to study the effects of camel urine in inhibiting the growth potential and metastatic ability of 4T1 cancer cell line in vitro and in vivo. Based on the MTT result, the cytotoxicity of camel urine against 4T1 cell was established, and it was dose-dependent. Additionally, the antimetastatic potential of camel urine was tested by running several assays such as scratch assay, migration and invasion assay, and mouse aortic ring assay with promising results in the ability of camel urine to inhibit metastatic process of the 4T1 cells. In order to fully establish camel urine's potential, an in vivo study was carried out by treating mice inoculated with 4T1 cells with 2 different doses of camel urine. By the end of the treatment period, the tumor in both treated groups had reduced in size as compared to the control group. Additional assays such as the TUNEL assay, immunophenotyping, cytokine level detection assay, clonogenic assay, and proteome profiler demonstrated the capability of camel urine to reduce and inhibit the metastatic potential of 4T1 cells in vivo. To sum up, further study of anticancer properties of camel urine is justified, as evidenced through the in vitro and in vivo studies carried out. Better results were obtained at higher concentration of camel urine used in vivo. Apart from that, this project has laid out the mechanisms employed by the substance to inhibit the growth and the metastatic process of the 4T1 cell.	2017

27270560	Intratumoral heterogeneity of Ki67 expression in early breast cancers exceeds variability between individual tumours.	Regional differences in proliferative activity are commonly seen within breast cancers, but little is known on the extent of intratumoral heterogeneity of Ki67 expression. Our aim was to study the intratumoral heterogeneity of Ki67 expression in early breast cancers and its association with clinicopathological features, such as oestrogen receptor (ER) status, grade and histological subtype.	The Ki67-labelling index (Ki67-LI) was assessed in hot, cold and intermediate spots of 233 invasive breast cancers by counting a total of 1020 cells, according to a protocol of the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group. Differences between the spots per tumour were analysed further for clinicopathological subgroups defined by ER status, grade and histological subtype. All clinicopathological subgroups showed significant differences in Ki67-LI between hot, intermediate and cold spots (P < 0.0001). The coefficient of variance (CV) between the spots was higher in ER-positive than in ER-negative cancers (72.6 versus 49.2%, P < 0.0001), and was highest in grade 3 (96.12%), grade 1 (87.27%) and invasive lobular tumours (83.59%) and lowest in medullary (26.48%) cancers. Nested analysis of variance indicated that in both ER-positive and ER-negative cancers, variance in Ki67-LI within tumours contributed more to the total variance (56% for ER-positive, 60% for ER-negative cancers) than the variance between tumours.	Intratumoral heterogeneity in Ki67-LI is a ubiquitous phenomenon across various pathological subgroups of breast cancer that may impact assessment of Ki67 levels for clinical decision-making, and sheds new light on recommended cut-offs.	2016
27255182	Methionine-restricted diet inhibits growth of MCF10AT1-derived mammary tumors by increasing cell cycle inhibitors in athymic nude mice.	Dietary methionine restriction (MR) improves healthspan in part by reducing adiposity and by increasing insulin sensitivity in rodent models. The purpose of this study was to determine whether MR inhibits tumor progression in breast cancer xenograft model and breast cancer cell lines.	Athymic nude mice were injected with MCF10AT1 cells in Matrigel® and fed a diet containing either 0.86 % methionine (control fed, CF), or 0.12 % methionine (MR) for 12 weeks. Plasma amino acid concentrations were measured by UPLC, and proliferation and apoptosis were examined using RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Cell Titer 96® Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay.	Mice on the MR diet had reduced body weight and decreased adiposity. They also had smaller tumors when compared to the mice bearing tumors on the CF diet. Plasma concentrations of the sulfur amino acids (methionine, cysteine, and taurine) were reduced, whereas ornithine, serine, and glutamate acid were increased in mice on the MR diet. MR mice exhibited decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in cells that comprise the mammary glands and tumors of mice. Elevated expression of P21 occurred in both MCF10AT1-derived tumor tissue and endogenously in mammary gland tissue of MR mice. Breast cancer cell lines MCF10A and MDA-MB-231 grown in methionine-restricted cysteine-depleted media for 24 h also up-regulated P21 and P27 gene expression, and MDA-MB-231 cells had decreased proliferation.	MR hinders cancer progression by increasing cell cycle inhibitors that halt cell cycle progression. The application of MR in a clinical setting may provide a delay in the progression of cancer, which would provide more time for conventional cancer therapies to be effective.	2016
27184401	Mule Regulates the Intestinal Stem Cell Niche via the Wnt Pathway and Targets EphB3 for Proteasomal and Lysosomal Degradation.	The E3 ubiquitin ligase Mule is often overexpressed in human colorectal cancers, but its role in gut tumorigenesis is unknown. Here, we show in vivo that Mule controls murine intestinal stem and progenitor cell proliferation by modulating Wnt signaling via c-Myc. Mule also regulates protein levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB3 by targeting it for proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. In the intestine, EphB/ephrinB interactions position cells along the crypt-villus axis and compartmentalize incipient colorectal tumors. Our study thus unveils an important new avenue by which Mule acts as an intestinal tumor suppressor by regulation of the intestinal stem cell niche.	2016
27165209	Spatial Analysis of Breast Cancer Incidence in Iran.	Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in females (27% of the total) and the main cause of death (16%) due to cancer in women in developed and developing countries. Variations in its incidence rate among geographical areas are due to various contributing factors. Since there have been a lack of studies on this topic in our country, the present spatial analysis of breast cancer incidence in Iran in 2009 was conducted using data from the national cancer registry system. The reported incidences of the disease were standardized according to the World Health Organization population and the direct method. Then data was inserted into the GIS software and finally, using the Hot Spot Analysis (Geties-Ord Gi), high-risk areas were drawn. Provinces with incidences 1.96 SD higher or lower than the national average were considered as hot spots or cold spots, at the significance level of 0.05%. In 2009, a total of 7,582 cases of BC occurred in Iran. The annual incidence was 33.2 per hundred thousand people. Our study showed that the highest incidence of BC in women occurred in the central provinces of the country, Tehran, Isfahan, Yazd, Markazi and Fars. The results of hot spots analysis showed that the distribution of high-risk BC was focused in central parts of Iran, especially Isfahan province (p <0.01). The other provinces were not significantly different from the national average. The higher incidence in central provinces may be due to greater exposure to carcinogens in urban areas, a Western lifestyle and high prevalence of other risk factors. Further epidemiological studies about the etiology and early detection of BC are essential.	2016
27148582	Molecular analysis of a male breast cancer patient with prolonged stable disease under mTOR/PI3K inhibitors BEZ235/everolimus.	The mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus (Afinitor/RAD001) has been approved for multiple cancer indications, including ER(+)/HER2(-) metastatic breast cancer. However, the combination of everolimus with the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 was shown to be more efficacious than either everolimus or BEZ235 alone in preclinical models. Herein, we describe a male breast cancer (MBC) patient who was diagnosed with hormone receptor-positive (HR(+))/HER2(-) stage IIIA invasive ductal carcinoma and sequentially treated with chemoradiotherapy and hormonal therapy. Upon the development of metastases, the patient began a 200 mg twice-daily BEZ235 and 2.5 mg weekly everolimus combination regimen. The patient sustained a prolonged stable disease of 18 mo while undergoing the therapy, before his tumor progressed again. Therefore, we sought to both better understand MBC and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of the patient's sensitivity and subsequent resistance to the BEZ235/everolimus combination therapy. Genomic and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on samples collected from the initial invasive ductal carcinoma pretreatment and a metastasis postprogression on the BEZ235/everolimus combination treatment. Both tumors were relatively quiet genomically with no overlap to recurrent MBC alterations in the literature. Markers of PI3K/mTOR pathway hyperactivation were not identified in the pretreatment sample, which complements previous reports of HR(+) female breast cancers being responsive to mTOR inhibition without this activation. The postprogression sample, however, demonstrated greater than fivefold increased estrogen receptor and pathogenesis-related protein expression, which could have constrained the PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition by BEZ235/everolimus. Overall, these analyses have augmented the limited episteme on MBC genetics and treatment.	2016
27146710	Cold thermal injury from cold caps used for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia.	The use of scalp cooling for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is increasing. Cold caps are placed onto the hair-bearing areas of the scalp for varying time periods before, during, and after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Although not yet reported, improper application procedures could result in adverse events (AEs). At present, there are no evidence-based scalp cooling protocols, and there is no regulatory oversight of their use.	To report the occurrence of cold thermal injury (frostbite) on the scalp, following the use of cold caps for the prevention of CIA.	We identified four patients who developed cold thermal injuries on the scalp following the application of cold caps. Medical records were analyzed to retrieve the demographic and clinical characteristics.	The cold thermal injuries in our patients were grade 1/2 in severity and improved with topical interventions and interruption of cold cap use, although grade 1 persistent alopecia ensued in 3 patients. The true incidence of such injuries in this setting, however, remains unknown.	Cold thermal injuries are likely infrequent and preventable AEs that may result from improper device application procedures during cold cap use. Although these untoward events are usually mild to moderate in severity, the potential occurrence of long-term sequelae (e.g., permanent alopecia and scarring) or the need to discontinue cold cap use, are not known. Prospective studies are needed to further elucidate the risk and standardize healthcare delivery methods, and to improve patient/supportive/healthcare provider education.	2016
27099532	Seasonality in acute liver injury? Findings in two health care claims databases.	Presumed seasonal use of acetaminophen-containing products for relief of cold/influenza ("flu") symptoms suggests that there might also be a corresponding seasonal pattern for acute liver injury (ALI), a known clinical consequence of acetaminophen overdose.	The objective of this study was to determine whether there were any temporal patterns in hospitalizations for ALI that would correspond to assumed acetaminophen use in cold/flu season.	In the period 2002-2010, monthly hospitalization rates for ALI using a variety of case definitions were calculated. Data sources included Truven MarketScan(®) Commercial Claims and Encounters (CCAE) and Medicare Supplemental and Coordination of Benefits (MDCR) databases. We performed a statistical test for seasonality of diagnoses using the periodic generalized linear model. To validate that the test can distinguish seasonal from nonseasonal patterns, we included two positive controls (ie, diagnoses of the common cold [acute nasopharyngitis] and influenza), believed to change with seasons, and two negative controls (female breast cancer and diabetes), believed to be insensitive to season.	A seasonal pattern was observed in monthly rates for common cold and influenza diagnoses, but this pattern was not observed for monthly rates of ALI, with or without comorbidities (cirrhosis or hepatitis), breast cancer, or diabetes. The statistical test for seasonality was significant for positive controls (P<0.001 for each diagnosis in both databases) and nonsignificant for ALI and negative controls.	No seasonal pattern was observed in the diagnosis of ALI. The positive and negative controls showed the expected patterns, strengthening the validity of the statistical and visual tests used for detecting seasonality.	2016
27037077	Techniques to Distinguish Apoptosis from Necroptosis.	The processes by which cells die are as tightly regulated as those that govern cell growth and proliferation. Recent studies of the molecular pathways that regulate and execute cell death have uncovered a plethora of signaling cascades that lead to distinct modes of cell death, including "apoptosis," "necrosis," "autophagic cell death," and "mitotic catastrophe." Cells can readily switch from one form of death to another; therefore, it is vital to have the ability to monitor the form of death that cells are undergoing. A number of techniques are available that allow the detection of cell death and when combined with either knockdown approaches or inhibitors of specific signaling pathways, such as caspase or RIP kinase pathways, they allow the rapid dissection of divergent cell death pathways. However, techniques that reveal the end point of cell death cannot reconstruct the sequence of events that have led to death; therefore, they need to be complemented with methods that can distinguish all forms of cell death. Apoptotic cells frequently undergo secondary necrosis under in vitro culture conditions; therefore, novel methods relying on high-throughput time-lapse fluorescence video microscopy are necessary to provide temporal resolution to cell death events. Further, visualizing the assembly of multiprotein signaling hubs that can execute apoptosis or necroptosis helps to explore the underlying processes. Here we introduce a suite of techniques that reliably distinguish necrosis from apoptosis and secondary necrosis, and that enable investigation of signaling platforms capable of instructing apoptosis or necroptosis.	2016
27037070	Analysis of Apoptosis and Necroptosis by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting.	Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) is a laser-based, biophysical technology that allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis. For the analysis of dying cells, fluorescently labeled Annexin V (Annexin V(FITC)) and propidium iodide (PI) are the most commonly used reagents. Instead of PI, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) can also be used. DAPI is a fluorescent stain that binds strongly to A-T-rich regions in DNA. DAPI and PI only inefficiently pass through an intact cell membrane and, therefore, preferentially stain dead cells. DAPI can be combined with Annexin V(FITC)and the potentiometric fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), which measures mitochondrial permeability transition and mitochondrial membrane depolarization. TMRM is a cell-permeable fluorescent dye that is sequestered to active mitochondria, and hence labels live cells. On apoptosis or necroptosis the TMRM signal is lost. The advantage of using Annexin V(FITC)/DAPI/TMRM is that the entire cell population is labeled, and it is easy to distinguish living (TMRM + /Annexin V(FITC)-/DAPI-) from dying or dead cells (apoptosis: TMRM-/Annexin V(FITC)+ /DAPI-; necrosis: TMRM-/Annexin V(FITC)+ /DAPI+). This is important because cell debris (fluorescent negative particles) must be avoided to establish the correct parameters for the FACS analysis, otherwise incorrect statistical values will be obtained. To obtain information on the cell concentration or absolute cell counts in a sample, it is recommended to add an internal microsphere counting standard to the flow cytrometric sample. This protocol describes the FACS analysis of cell death in HT1080 and L929 cells, but it can be readily adapted to other cell types of interest.	2016
26960396	The Genomic Landscape of Male Breast Cancers.	Male breast cancer is rare, and its genomic landscape has yet to be fully characterized. Lacking studies in men, treatment of males with breast cancer is extrapolated from results in females with breast cancer. We sought to define whether male breast cancers harbor somatic genetic alterations in genes frequently altered in female breast cancers.	All male breast cancers were estrogen receptor-positive, and all but two were HER2-negative. Fifty-nine male breast cancers were subtyped by immunohistochemistry, and tumor-normal pairs were microdissected and subjected to massively parallel sequencing targeting all exons of 241 genes frequently mutated in female breast cancers or DNA-repair related. The repertoires of somatic mutations and copy number alterations of male breast cancers were compared with that of subtype-matched female breast cancers.	Twenty-nine percent and 71% of male breast cancers were immunohistochemically classified as luminal A-like or luminal B-like, respectively. Male breast cancers displayed a heterogeneous repertoire of somatic genetic alterations that to some extent recapitulated that of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers, including recurrent mutations affecting PIK3CA (20%) and GATA3 (15%). ER-positive/HER2-negative male breast cancers, however, less frequently harbored 16q losses, and PIK3CA and TP53 mutations than ER-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers. In addition, male breast cancers were found to be significantly enriched for mutations affecting DNA repair-related genes.	Male breast cancers less frequently harbor somatic genetic alterations typical of ER-positive/HER2-negative female breast cancers, such as PIK3CA and TP53 mutations and losses of 16q, suggesting that at least a subset of male breast cancers are driven by a distinct repertoire of somatic changes. Given the genomic differences, caution may be needed in the application of biologic and therapeutic findings from studies of female breast cancers to male breast cancers.

26933245	Time-Lapse Imaging of Cell Death.	The best approach to distinguish between necrosis and apoptosis is time-lapse video microscopy. This technique enables a biological process to be photographed at regular intervals over a period, which may last from a few hours to several days, and can be applied to cells in culture or in vivo. We have established two time-lapse microscopy methods based on different ways of calculating cell death: semiautomated and automated. In the semiautomated approach, cell death can be visualized by staining with combinations of Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Annexin V and Sytox Green (SG), or Annexin V(FITC) and Propidium iodide (PI). The automated method is similar except that all cells are labeled with dyes. This allows faster quantification of data. To this end Cell Tracker Green is used to label all cells at time zero in combination with PI and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated Annexin V. Necrotic cell death is accompanied by either simultaneous labeling with Annexin V and PI or SG (double-positive), or direct PI or SG staining. Additionally, necrotic cells display characteristic morphology, such as cytoplasmic swelling. In contrast to necrosis where membrane permeabilization is an early event, cells that die by apoptosis lose their membrane permeability relatively late. Therefore, the time between Annexin V staining and PI or SG uptake (double-positive) can be used to distinguish necrosis from apoptosis. This protocol describes the analysis of cell death by time-lapse imaging of HT1080 and L929 cells stained with these dyes, but it can be readily adapted to other cell types of interest.	2016
26929372	Pten loss promotes MAPK pathway dependency in HER2/neu breast carcinomas.	Loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN is implicated in breast cancer progression and resistance to targeted therapies, and is thought to promote tumorigenesis by activating PI3K signaling. In a transgenic model of breast cancer, Pten suppression using a tetracycline-regulatable short hairpin (sh)RNA cooperates with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu), leading to aggressive and metastatic disease with elevated signaling through PI3K and, surprisingly, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Restoring Pten function is sufficient to down-regulate both PI3K and MAPK signaling and triggers dramatic tumor regression. Pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK signaling produces similar effects to Pten restoration, suggesting that the MAPK pathway contributes to the maintenance of advanced breast cancers harboring Pten loss.	2016
26917087	Synergistic Effect of Cold Atmospheric Plasma and Drug Loaded Core-shell Nanoparticles on Inhibiting Breast Cancer Cell Growth.	Nano-based drug delivery devices allowing for effective and sustained targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to solid tumors have revolutionized cancer treatment. As an emerging biomedical technique, cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), an ionized non-thermal gas mixture composed of various reactive oxygen species, reactive nitrogen species, and UV photons, shows great potential for cancer treatment. Here we seek to develop a new dual cancer therapeutic method by integrating promising CAP and novel drug loaded core-shell nanoparticles and evaluate its underlying mechanism for targeted breast cancer treatment. For this purpose, core-shell nanoparticles were synthesized via co-axial electrospraying. Biocompatible poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) was selected as the polymer shell to encapsulate anti-cancer therapeutics. Results demonstrated uniform size distribution and high drug encapsulation efficacy of the electrosprayed nanoparticles. Cell studies demonstrated the effectiveness of drug loaded nanoparticles and CAP for synergistic inhibition of breast cancer cell growth when compared to each treatment separately. Importantly, we found CAP induced down-regulation of metastasis related gene expression (VEGF, MTDH, MMP9, and MMP2) as well as facilitated drug loaded nanoparticle uptake which may aid in minimizing drug resistance-a major problem in chemotherapy. Thus, the integration of CAP and drug encapsulated nanoparticles provides a promising tool for the development of a new cancer treatment strategy.	2016
26857336	Analgesic and Sensory Effects of the Pecs Local Anesthetic Block in Patients with Persistent Pain after Breast Cancer Surgery: A Pilot Study.	Persistent pain after breast cancer surgery (PPBCS) develops in 15% to 25% of patients, sometimes years after surgery. Approximately 50% of PPBCS patients have neuropathic pain in the breast, which may be due to dysfunction of the pectoral nerves. The Pecs local anesthetic block proposes to block these nerves and has provided pain relief for patients undergoing breast cancer surgery, but has yet to be evaluated in patients with PPBCS.	The aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of the Pecs block on summed pain intensity (SPI) and sensory function (through quantitative sensory testing [QST]) in eight patients with PPBCS. SPI and QST measurements were recorded before and 30 minutes after administration of the Pecs block (20 mL 0.25% bupivacaine). Pain intensity and sleep interference were measured daily before and after the block for 7 days.	Patients experienced analgesia (P = 0.008) and reduced hypoesthesia areas to cold (P = 0.004) and warmth (P = 0.01) after 30 minutes. The reported pain relief (P = 0.02) and reduced sleep interference (P = 0.01) persisted for 7 days after the block.	This pilot study suggests that the pectoral nerves play a role in the maintenance of pain in the breast area in PPBCS and begs for further research.	2017
26832689	Methods to Study Metastasis in Genetically Modified Mice.	Metastasis is often modeled by xenotransplantation of cell lines in immunodeficient mice. A wealth of information about tumor cell behavior in the new environment is obtained from these efforts. Yet by design, this approach is "tumor-centric," as it focuses on cell-autonomous determinants of human tumor dissemination in mouse tissues, in effect using the animal body as a sophisticated "Petri dish" providing nutrients and support for tumor growth. Transgenic or gene knockout mouse models of cancer allow the study of tumor spread as a systemic disease and offer a complimentary approach for studying the natural history of cancer. This introduction is aimed at describing the overall methodological approach to studying metastasis in genetically modified mice, with a particular focus on using animals with regulated expression of potent human oncogenes in the breast.	2016
26808012	Effect of endocannabinoid degradation on pain: role of FAAH polymorphisms in experimental and postoperative pain in women treated for breast cancer.	Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) metabolizes the endocannabinoid anandamide, which has an important role in nociception. We investigated the role of common FAAH single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in experimentally induced and postoperative pain. One thousand women undergoing surgery for breast cancer participated in the study. They were tested for cold (n = 900) and heat pain (n = 1000) sensitivity. After surgery, their pain intensities and analgesic consumption were carefully registered. FAAH genotyping was performed using MassARRAY platform and genome-wide chip (n = 926). Association between 8 FAAH SNPs and 9 pain phenotypes was analyzed using linear regression models. The results showed that carrying 2 copies of a missense variant converting proline at position 129 to threonine (rs324420) resulted in significantly lower cold pain sensitivity and less need for postoperative analgesia. More specifically, rs324420 and another highly correlated SNP, rs1571138, associated significantly with cold pain intensity (corrected P value, 0.0014; recessive model). Patients homozygous for the minor allele (AA genotype) were less sensitive to cold pain (β = -1.48; 95% CI, -2.14 to -0.8). Two other SNPs (rs3766246 and rs4660928) showed nominal association with cold pain, and SNPs rs4141964, rs3766246, rs324420, and rs1571138 nominal association with oxycodone consumption. In conclusion, FAAH gene variation was shown to associate with cold pain sensitivity with P129T/rs324420 being the most likely causal variant as it is known to reduce the FAAH enzyme activity. The same variant showed nominal association with postoperative oxycodone consumption. Our conclusions are, however, limited by the lack of replication and the results should be replicated in an independent cohort.	2016
26803314	TRPM8: a potential target for cancer treatment.	Transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel superfamily plays critical roles in variety of processes, including temperature perception, pain transduction, vasorelaxation, male fertility, and tumorigenesis. One of seven families within the TRP superfamily of ion channels, the melastatin, or TRPM family comprises a group of eight structurally and functionally diverse channels. Of all the members of TRPM subfamily, TRPM8 is the most notable one. A lot of literatures have demonstrated that transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) could perform a myriad of functions in vertebrates and invertebrates alike. In addition to its well-known function in cold sensation, TRPM8 has an emerging role in a variety of biological systems, including thermoregulation, cancer, bladder function, and asthma. Recent studies have shown that TRPM8 is necessary to the initiation and progression of tumors, and the aberrant expression of TRPM8 was found in varieties of tumors, such as prostate tumor, melanoma, breast adenocarcinoma, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer, making it a novel molecular target potentially useful in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. This review outlines our current understanding on the role of TRPM8 in occurrence and development of different kinds of tumor and also includes discussion about the regulation of TRPM8 during carcinogenesis as well as therapeutic potential of targeting TRPM8 in tumor, which may be utilized for a potential pharmacological use as a target for anti-cancer therapy.	2016
26797787	Is cholesterol a mediator of cold-induced cancer?	Many factors such as smoking, obesity, and high fat have been either directly or indirectly linked to cancer deaths and/or incidences. Similarly, abnormal serum cholesterol levels have been assigned as a risk factor for cancer, but some studies show a discrepant result. To resolve this discrepancy, we have analyzed cholesterol data of 166 countries. Univariate analysis showed a positive correlation between serum average total cholesterol (ATC) and overall cancer mortality rate (CMR) [tau = 0.277, z = 5.19, p < 0.0001]. It was also observed that a similar positive correlation was found between ATC and different anatomical site-specific CMRs in lung, bladder, ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Our recent published data documented an existence of a negative correlation between average annual temperature (AAT) and overall CMR, as well as CMR of the abovementioned anatomical site-specific cancers. Statistical analysis further shows a negative correlation between AAT and ATC, similar to that of AAT and CMR. The resulting patterns of univariate analysis between AAT and CMR are almost identical with AAT and ATC, when this analysis was performed every 2 °C of AAT increment for all countries. Moreover, geographical location of the top 50 countries having the highest CMR is almost similar to the top 50 countries having the highest ATC. Similarly, the least 50 countries having the lowest CMR are located in the same geographical region, similar to the least 50 countries having the lowest ATC. These data along with other literature reports suggest that cholesterol could be a mediator of cold-induced cancer mortality.	2016
26781003	Trends in breast cancer in the elderly in Denmark, 1980-2012.	Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy among women worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related death in developed countries. The aim of the present analysis is to describe trends in incidence, mortality, prevalence, and relative survival in Denmark from 1980 to 2012 focusing on age, comparing persons aged 70 years or more with those aged less than 70 years.	Cancer of the breast was defined as ICD-10 code C50. Data derived from the NORDCAN database with comparable data on cancer incidence, mortality, prevalence and relative survival in the Nordic countries, where the Danish data were delivered from the Danish Cancer Registry and the Danish Cause of Death Registry with follow-up for death or emigration until the end of 2013.	The proportion of patients diagnosed with breast cancer over the age of 70 years increased with time to 29% of women and 44% of men in 2012. Incidence rates increased with time and peaked around 2010 in all age groups except for those aged 90 years or more. Mortality rates were clearly separated by age with increasing mortality rates by increasing age group for both women and men. Relative survival increased over time in all age groups, but patients aged 70 years or more had a poorer relative survival than those aged less than 70 years. In 2012, 58 521 persons (all ages) were alive in Denmark after a diagnosis of breast cancer.	Poorer survival of Danish breast cancer patients over the age of 70 years is likely to be due to inferior treatment and non-adherence to treatment guidelines. There is a need for clinical trials focusing on patients over the age of 70 years.	2016
26780081	Targeted scVEGF/(177)Lu radiopharmaceutical inhibits growth of metastases and can be effectively combined with chemotherapy.	scVEGF/(177)Lu is a novel radiopharmaceutical targeted by recombinant single-chain (sc) derivative of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) that binds to and is internalized by vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR). scVEGF/(177)Lu potential as adjuvant and neoadjuvant anti-angiogenic therapy was assessed in metastatic and orthotopic mouse models of triple-negative breast cancer.	Metastatic lesions in Balb/c mice were established by intracardiac injection of luciferase-expressing 4T1luc mouse breast carcinoma cells. Mice with metastatic lesions received single intravenous (i.v.) injection of well-tolerated dose of scVEGF/(177)Lu (7.4 MBq/mouse) at day 8 after 4T1luc cell injection. Primary orthotopic breast tumors in immunodeficient mice were established by injecting luciferase-expressing MDA231luc human breast carcinoma cells into mammary fat pad. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with single injections of scVEGF/(177)Lu (7.4 MBq/mouse, i.v), or liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil, 1 mg doxorubicin per kg, i.v.), or with a combination of Doxil and scVEGF/(177)Lu given at the same doses, but two hours apart. "Cold" scVEGF-targeting conjugate was included in controls and in Doxil alone group. The effects of treatments were defined by bioluminescent imaging (BLI), computed tomography (CT), computed microtomography (microCT), measurements of primary tumor growth, and immunohistochemical analysis.	In metastatic model, adjuvant treatment with scVEGF/(177)Lu decreased overall metastatic burden and improved survival. In orthotopic primary tumor model, a combination of Doxil and scVEGF/(177)Lu was more efficient in tumor growth inhibition than each treatment alone. scVEGF/(177)Lu treatment decreased immunostaining for VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and pro-tumorigenic M2-type macrophage marker CD206.	Selective targeting of VEGFR with well-tolerated doses of scVEGF/(177)Lu is effective in metastatic and primary breast cancer models and can be combined with chemotherapy. As high level of VEGFR expression is a common feature in a variety of cancers, targeted delivery of (177)Lu for specific receptor-mediated uptake warrants further exploration.	2016
26763249	Adaptation to AI Therapy in Breast Cancer Can Induce Dynamic Alterations in ER Activity Resulting in Estrogen-Independent Metastatic Tumors.	Acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy is a major clinical problem in the treatment of breast cancer. The detailed mechanisms of how tumor cells develop this resistance remain unclear. Here, the adapted function of estrogen receptor (ER) to an estrogen-depleted environment following AI treatment is reported.	Global ER chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP)-seq analysis of AI-resistant cells identified steroid-independent ER target genes. Matched patient tumor samples, collected before and after AI treatment, were used to assess ER activity.	Maintained ER activity was observed in patient tumors following neoadjuvant AI therapy. Genome-wide ER-DNA-binding analysis in AI-resistant cell lines identified a subset of classic ligand-dependent ER target genes that develop steroid independence. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant association between tumors, which fail to decrease this steroid-independent ER target gene set in response to neoadjuvant AI therapy, and poor disease-free survival and overall survival (n = 72 matched patient tumor samples, P = 0.00339 and 0.00155, respectively). The adaptive ER response to AI treatment was highlighted by the ER/AIB1 target gene, early growth response 3 (EGR3). Elevated levels of EGR3 were detected in endocrine-resistant local disease recurrent patient tumors in comparison with matched primary tissue. However, evidence from distant metastatic tumors demonstrates that the ER signaling network may undergo further adaptations with disease progression as estrogen-independent ER target gene expression is routinely lost in established metastatic tumors.	Overall, these data provide evidence of a dynamic ER response to endocrine treatment that may provide vital clues for overcoming the clinical issue of therapy resistance.

26701265	Differentiation of mammary tumors and reduction in metastasis upon Malat1 lncRNA loss.	Genome-wide analyses have identified thousands of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Malat1 (metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1) is among the most abundant lncRNAs whose expression is altered in numerous cancers. Here we report that genetic loss or systemic knockdown of Malat1 using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) in the MMTV (mouse mammary tumor virus)-PyMT mouse mammary carcinoma model results in slower tumor growth accompanied by significant differentiation into cystic tumors and a reduction in metastasis. Furthermore, Malat1 loss results in a reduction of branching morphogenesis in MMTV-PyMT- and Her2/neu-amplified tumor organoids, increased cell adhesion, and loss of migration. At the molecular level, Malat1 knockdown results in alterations in gene expression and changes in splicing patterns of genes involved in differentiation and protumorigenic signaling pathways. Together, these data demonstrate for the first time a functional role of Malat1 in regulating critical processes in mammary cancer pathogenesis. Thus, Malat1 represents an exciting therapeutic target, and Malat1 ASOs represent a potential therapy for inhibiting breast cancer progression.	2016
26677750	Principles of using Cold Atmospheric Plasma Stimulated Media for Cancer Treatment.	To date, the significant anti-cancer capacity of cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) on dozens of cancer cell lines has been demonstrated in vitro and in mice models. Conventionally, CAP was directly applied to irradiate cancer cells or tumor tissue. Over past three years, the CAP irradiated media was also found to kill cancer cells as effectively as the direct CAP treatment. As a novel strategy, using the CAP stimulated (CAPs) media has become a promising anti-cancer tool. In this study, we demonstrated several principles to optimize the anti-cancer capacity of the CAPs media on glioblastoma cells and breast cancer cells. Specifically, using larger wells on a multi-well plate, smaller gaps between the plasma source and the media, and smaller media volume enabled us to obtain a stronger anti-cancer CAPs media composition without increasing the treatment time. Furthermore, cysteine was the main target of effective reactive species in the CAPs media. Glioblastoma cells were more resistant to the CAPs media than breast cancer cells. Glioblastoma cells consumed the effective reactive species faster than breast cancer cells did. In contrast to nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide was more likely to be the effective reactive species.	2015
26657220	Improved radiopharmaceutical based on 99mTc-Bombesin-folate for breast tumour imaging.	Clinical studies in women using technetium-99m (Tc)-Bombesin have shown successful radionuclide imaging of breast tumours overexpressing gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPRs). Recent studies have demonstrated that most breast tumours overexpress folate receptors (FRα).	The aim of this work was to synthesize the Lys(α,γ-Folate)-Lys(Tc-EDDA/HYNIC)-Bombesin (1-14) conjugate (Tc-Bombesin-Folate), as well as to assess the in-vitro and in-vivo potential of the radiopharmaceutical to target FRα and GRPR.	LysLys(HYNIC)-Bombesin (1-14) was conjugated to folic acid and the product was purified by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were used for chemical characterization. Tc labelling was performed using ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid/tricine as coligands. In-vitro binding studies were carried out in T47D breast cancer cells (positive for FRα and GRPR). Biodistribution studies and micro-single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography imaging were carried out on athymic mice with T47D-induced tumours.	High-performance liquid chromatography analyses indicated that the radioconjugate was obtained with high radiochemical purity (96±2.1%). In-vitro and in-vivo results showed significant uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in T47D cells and tumours (5.43% ID/g), which was significantly inhibited by preincubation with cold folic acid or cold Bombesin.	The Tc-Bombesin-folate heterobivalent radiopharmaceutical significantly enhances in-vivo tumour uptake because of the concomitant interaction with FRα and GRPR.	2016
26637438	p53 as an Effector or Inhibitor of Therapy Response.	Although integrity of the p53 signaling pathway in a given tumor was expected to be a critical determinant of response to therapies, most clinical studies failed to link p53 status and treatment outcome. Here, we present two opposite situations: one in which p53 is an essential effector of cure by targeted leukemia therapies and another one in advanced breast cancers in which p53 inactivation is required for the clinical efficacy of dose-dense chemotherapy. If p53 promotes or blocks therapy response, therapies must be tailored on its status in individual tumors.	2015
26629243	A case of Miller Fisher syndrome during preoperative chemotherapy for breast cancer.	A 53-year-old woman with breast cancer received FEC treatment (5FU: 500 mg/m(2), epirubicin: 100 mg/m(2), and cyclophosphamide: 500 mg/m(2)) every 3 weeks as preoperative chemotherapy. Fifteen days after her third cycle of FEC, she developed a cold. Diplopia occurred 4 days after developing the cold, and progressive paresthesia of the hands and weakness of the limbs occurred. She had ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and are flexia and was diagnosed with Miller Fisher Syndrome (MFS). The cause of MFS during chemotherapy is believed to be caused by an immunological response to infection, or drug neurotoxicity. In our case, since the patient underwent an antecedent upper respiratory infection in the period of myelosuppression, her MFS was probably induced by the immunoreaction associated with this infection. Our patient underwent intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. After initiation of the treatment, her neurological symptoms improved, then, she received a fourth cycle of FEC and her remaining neurological symptoms did not worsen. Thus, we report a rare case of MFS developed in immunosuppression by chemotherapy and remind physicians of the alarming triad of MFS symptoms.	2015
26522612	Potentialities of steady-state and transient thermography in breast tumour depth detection: A numerical study.	Breast thermography still has inherent limitations that prevent it from being fully accepted as a breast screening modality in medicine. The main challenges of breast thermography are to reduce false positive results and to increase the sensitivity of a thermogram. Further, it is still difficult to obtain information about tumour parameters such as metabolic heat, tumour depth and diameter from a thermogram. However, infrared technology and image processing have advanced significantly and recent clinical studies have shown increased sensitivity of thermography in cancer diagnosis. The aim of this paper is to study numerically the possibilities of extracting information about the tumour depth from steady state thermography and transient thermography after cold stress with no need to use any specific inversion technique. Both methods are based on the numerical solution of Pennes bioheat equation for a simple three-dimensional breast model. The effectiveness of two approaches used for depth detection from steady state thermography is assessed. The effect of breast density on the steady state thermal contrast has also been studied. The use of a cold stress test and the recording of transient contrasts during rewarming were found to be potentially suitable for tumour depth detection during the rewarming process. Sensitivity to parameters such as cold stress temperature and cooling time is investigated using the numerical model and simulation results reveal two prominent depth-related characteristic times which do not strongly depend on the temperature of the cold stress or on the cooling period.	2016
26503758	In vivo dosimetric impact of breast tissue expanders on post-mastectomy radiotherapy.	Temporary tissue expanders with metallic ports for gradual saline injection are increasingly employed to facilitate breast reconstruction after post-mastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT). Treatment beams therefore pass through a high-density rare-earth magnet. Measurements ex vivo suggest attenuation of dose to the skin and chest wall at clinical risk of relapse. The purpose of the study was to quantify the resulting dose reduction in vivo, compared with treatment planning system (TPS).	Sixteen patients receiving PMRT had in vivo dosimetry prospectively performed with ethics board approval. Port was located within the expanded chest wall using the planning CT scan. Strips of radiochromic film were laid on the skin surface underneath the bolus. To aid interpretation, ex vivo measurements were also performed, including comparison with TPS predictions.	An average 7% reduction in dose to skin surface was measured in 15 of 16 patients. This was reproducibly located in the 'shadow' of the magnet, corresponding to each of the paths of the medial and lateral tangents. The average area was 1.07 cm(2) (range 0.39 cm(2) to 2.36 cm(2)). Ex vivo measurements confirmed attenuation of the beam in the shadow of the port. The surface area of the 'cold-spot' varied with angle of the beam relative to the metallic port. Dose attenuation in vivo differed from that predicted by the TPS.	Dose is attenuated in the 'shadow' of the tissue expander port in patients receiving PMRT. This is likely to be clinically insignificant for most, but centres should undertake appropriate measurements before utilising TPS predictions.	2016
26490253	The spliceosome, a potential Achilles heel of MYC-driven tumors.	Alterations in RNA splicing are frequent in human tumors. Two recent studies of lymphoma and breast cancer have identified components of the spliceosome - the core splicing machinery - that are essential for malignant transformation driven by the transcription factor MYC. These findings provide a direct link between MYC and RNA splicing deregulation, and raise the exciting possibility of targeting spliceosome components in MYC-driven tumors.	2015
26446738	Association between sensory dysfunction and pain 1 week after breast cancer surgery: a psychophysical study.	Breast cancer patients treated with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) have a higher risk of both acute and persistent pain than those treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This could be attributed to a higher risk of nerve injury with ALND. We hypothesized that (1) pain patients have more pronounced sensory dysfunction than pain-free patients, (2) ALND have more sensory dysfunction and pain than SLNB patients and (3) patients with preserved intercostobrachial nerve (ICBN) preservation have less sensory dysfunction compared to a sectioned ICBN.	Twenty-seven patients treated with ALND and 27 with SLNB examined with a standardized Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST) protocol, including sensory mapping, mechanical and thermal thresholds, as well as recording intraoperative ICBN handling and pain status 1 week post-operative.	The area of cold hypoaesthesia was significantly associated with movement-related pain (P = 0.004), with a similar tendency for warmth (P = 0.018) and brush (P = 0.030) hypoaesthesia areas. 14 (26%) of the patients had moderate/severe pain at rest and 13 (24%) during movement without differences between ALND and SLNB, but ALND was associated with more sensory dysfunction than SLNB. Patients with sectioned ICBN reported lower pain intensity than those with preserved ICBN (P = 0.005), but without differences in sensory dysfunction.	Pain was increased in patients having larger areas of hypoaesthesia and reduced in patients where ICBN-section was done. Sensory dysfunction was related to extent of axillary surgery, but not with ICBN handling. Our data suggest that acute pain after breast cancer surgery may be related to nerve injury.	2016
26437889	Structural Characterization of Sm(III)(EDTMP).	Samarium-153 ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(methylenephosphonic acid) ((153)Sm-EDTMP, or samarium lexidronam), also known by its registered trademark name Quadramet, is an approved therapeutic radiopharmaceutical used in the palliative treatment of painful bone metastases. Typically, patients with prostate, breast, or lung cancer are most likely to go on to require bone pain palliation treatment due to bone metastases. Sm(EDTMP) is a bone-seeking drug which accumulates on rapidly growing bone, thereby delivering a highly region-specific dose of radiation, chiefly through β particle emission. Even with its widespread clinical use, the structure of Sm(EDTMP) has not yet been characterized at atomic resolution, despite attempts to crystallize the complex. Herein, we prepared a 1:1 complex of the cold (stable isotope) of Sm(EDTMP) under alkaline conditions and then isolated and characterized the complex using conventional spectroscopic techniques, as well as with extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy and density functional structure calculations, using natural abundance Sm. We present the atomic resolution structure of [Sm(III)(EDTMP)-8H](5-) for the first time, supported by the EXAFS data and complementary spectroscopic techniques, which demonstrate that the samarium coordination environment in solution is in agreement with the structure that has long been conjectured.	2015
26431027	SRSF1-Regulated Alternative Splicing in Breast Cancer.	Splicing factor SRSF1 is upregulated in human breast tumors, and its overexpression promotes transformation of mammary cells. Using RNA-seq, we identified SRSF1-regulated alternative splicing (AS) targets in organotypic three-dimensional MCF-10A cell cultures that mimic a context relevant to breast cancer. We identified and validated hundreds of endogenous SRSF1-regulated AS events. De novo discovery of the SRSF1 binding motif reconciled discrepancies in previous motif analyses. Using a Bayesian model, we determined positional effects of SRSF1 binding on cassette exons: binding close to the 5' splice site generally promoted exon inclusion, whereas binding near the 3' splice site promoted either exon skipping or inclusion. Finally, we identified SRSF1-regulated AS events deregulated in human tumors; overexpressing one such isoform, exon-9-included CASC4, increased acinar size and proliferation, and decreased apoptosis, partially recapitulating SRSF1's oncogenic effects. Thus, we uncovered SRSF1 positive and negative regulatory mechanisms, and oncogenic AS events that represent potential targets for therapeutics development.	2015
26320692	Shotgun proteomic analysis of tiger milk mushroom (Lignosus rhinocerotis) and the isolation of a cytotoxic fungal serine protease from its sclerotium.	The sclerotium of Lignosus rhinocerotis (Cooke) Ryvarden (tiger milk mushroom) has been traditionally used as a complementary and alternative medicine for cancer treatment by the local communities of Southeast Asia. Despite the continuous research interest in its antiproliferative activity, the identity of the bioactive compound(s) responsible has yet to be determined. This study aims to bridge the gap in existing research literature by using proteomics approach for investigation of the nature of the anticancer substance of L. rhinocerotis.	To elucidate the proteome of L. rhinocerotis TM02 sclerotium by protein mass spectrometry and to further isolate and identify the cytotoxic component(s) bearing anticancer potential.	The proteome of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium was analyzed by label-free quantitative shotgun proteomics, using 1D-SDS-PAGE coupled with nano-ESI-LC-MS/MS based on the availability of its genome-sequence database. The cytotoxicity of L. rhinocerotis sclerotial extracts against human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF7) were assessed by MTT cytotoxicity assay prior to successive purification steps by a combination of gel filtration chromatography, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and anion exchange chromatography. Bioactive compound(s) in the extracts was identified by shotgun proteomics and N-terminal protein sequencing.	Several proteins with interesting biological activities including lectins, fungal immunomodulatory proteins, and several antioxidant proteins were identified from the proteome of L. rhinocerotis. A cytotoxic protein fraction (termed F5) which was partially purified from its sclerotial cold water extract F5 shows two distinct bands of 31 and 36 kDa in reducing SDS-PAGE and exhibited potent selective cytotoxicity against MCF7 cells with IC50 value of 3.00 ± 1.01 μg/ml. Both bands were identified to be serine protease by LC-MS/MS analysis. Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, a specific serine protease inhibitor, inhibited both the proteolytic activity and cytotoxicity of F5, suggesting that the cytotoxicity of F5 is related to its protease activity.	This study provides the first comprehensive and semi-quantitative profiling of the proteome of L. rhinocerotis sclerotium. Further investigation into its selective cytotoxicity shows that a serine protease-like protein, termed F5, may be targeted for new anticancer agent development.	2015
26305398	Discriminating a Single Nucleotide Difference for Enhanced miRNA Detection Using Tunable Graphene and Oligonucleotide Nanodevices.	In this study we have reported our efforts to address some of the challenges in the detection of miRNAs using water-soluble graphene oxide and DNA nanoassemblies. Purposefully inserting mismatches at specific positions in our DNA (probe) strands shows increasing specificity against our target miRNA, miR-10b, over miR-10a which varies by only a single nucleotide. This increased specificity came at a loss of signal intensity within the system, but we demonstrated that this could be addressed with the use of DNase I, an endonuclease capable of cleaving the DNA strands of the RNA/DNA heteroduplex and recycling the RNA target to hybridize to another probe strand. As we previously demonstrated, this enzymatic signal also comes with an inherent activity of the enzyme on the surface-adsorbed probe strands. To remove this activity of DNase I and the steady nonspecific increase in the fluorescence signal without compromising the recovered signal, we attached a thermoresponsive PEGMA polymer (poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate) to nGO. This smart polymer is able to shield the probes adsorbed on the nGO surface from the DNase I activity and is capable of tuning the detection capacity of the nGO nanoassembly with a thermoswitch at 39 °C. By utilizing probes with multiple mismatches, DNase I cleavage of the DNA probe strands, and the attachment of PEGMA polymers to graphene oxide to block undesired DNase I activity, we were able to detect miR-10b from liquid biopsy mimics and breast cancer cell lines. Overall we have reported our efforts to improve the specificity, increase the sensitivity, and eliminate the undesired enzymatic activity of DNase I on surface-adsorbed probes for miR-10b detection using water-soluble graphene nanodevices. Even though we have demonstrated only the discrimination of miR-10b from miR-10a, our approach can be extended to other short RNA molecules which differ by a single nucleotide.	2015

26208488	Localized experimental bone metastasis drives osteolysis and sensory hypersensitivity at distant non-tumor-bearing sites.	Patients with breast cancer metastasis to bone suffer from inadequate pain relief. Animal models provide increased understanding of cancer-induced bone and sensory alterations. The objective of this study was to investigate the measures of pain at distant non-tumor-bearing sites in animals with localized bone metastasis. Immunocompetent BALB/c mice are injected intra-tibially with murine mammary carcinoma cells (4T1) or saline, and the sensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli in the contralateral paw was examined. In addition to previously demonstrated development of osteolysis and hypersensitivity to mechanical and thermal stimuli in the cancer-injected tibia, these animals exhibited an increase in sensory hypersensitivity in the contralateral limb. No bone lesions were evident on radiographs of the contralateral limbs. Histomorphometry detected decreased bone volume per tissue volume and increased osteoclast number in the contralateral tibia and vertebral bones of cancer-bearing animals. Neuroplasticity was examined by immunofluorescence for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in sensory neurons and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in lumbar spinal cords. CGRP-immunoreactivity and GFAP-immunoreactivity were significantly elevated both ipsilateral and contralateral in tumor-bearing animals. The anti-inflammatory and osteolysis-targeting drug rapamycin reduced hypersensitivity to mechanical and cold stimuli, attenuated GFAP over-expression, and lowered osteoclast number. The osteoclast-targeting drug pamidronate reduced sensitivity to cold and protected against bone loss. Localized bone cancer drives hypersensitivity, bone remodeling, and sensory neuron plasticity at sites distant from the primary tumor area. Drugs targeting these mechanisms may be useful in the treatment of pain distant from the primary tumor site.	2015
26158795	Anticancer Effects of Extracts from the Fruit of Morinda Citrifolia (Noni) in Breast Cancer Cell Lines.	Morinda citrifolia L. (NONI) fruits have been used for thousands of years for the treatment of many health problems including cancer, cold, diabetes, flu, hypertension, and pain. Plant extracts have reported several therapeutic benefits, but extraction of individual compound from the extract often exhibits limited clinical utility as the synergistic effect of various natural ingredients gets lost. They generally constitute polyphenols and flavonoids. Studies have suggested that these phytochemicals, especially polyphenols, display high antioxidant properties, which help to reduce the risk of degenerative diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Several in-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that Noni fruits have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-dementia, liver-protective, anticancer, analgesic, and immunomodulatory effects. Till date about 7 in vitro cancer studies have been done, but a detailed in vitro study including cell cycle and caspase activation assay on breast cancer cell line has not been done. In the present study different Noni fruit fractions have tested on cancer cell lines MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma) and one non-cancer cell line HEK-293 (Human embryonic kidney). Out of which ethylacetate extract showed a higher order of in vitro anticancer activity profile. The ethylacetate extract strongly inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and HEK-293 cell lines with IC50 values of 25, 35, 60 µg/ml respectively. The extract showed increase in apoptotic cells in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells and arrested the cell cycle in the G1/S phase in MCF-7 and G0/G1 phase in MDA-MB-231 cells. Noni extract also decreases the intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential.	2016
26083274	Biobanking multifocal breast carcinomas: sample adequacy with regard to histology and DNA content.	To determine the volume of tumoral and normal breast tissue containing sufficient DNA (>2 μg/sample) for genetic platforms and biobanking, with a focus on multifocality, tumoral heterogeneity, and factors that critically influence sample acceptability.	We examined 57 breast surgical specimens with multifocal (46/57) and unifocal (11/57) cancers. Punch biopsies were obtained from tissue slices under multimodal radiological guidance, and the colour-coded sampling sites were identified in large-format histology slides. The study comprised 415 DNA isolations from tumour (n = 105) and normal (n = 283) tissue, including skin (n = 27) samples. A single 2-mm core from invasive tumour contained sufficient DNA in 91.4% (96/105) of cases, depending on tumour type (3.8-108.2 μg/sample), number and size of additional foci in multifocal cases (P = 0.001), tumour consistency, and degree of necrosis. Three biopsies obtained with a 4-mm device were required from normal breast tissue, at least 10 mm from the tumour. Cold ischaemia for up to 82 min did not influence the yield of DNA.	Radiological disease mapping is useful for guiding optimal specimen slicing and for targeting breast lesions. A single 2-mm core from tumour and multiple 4-mm cores from normal breast tissue yield adequate DNA in the majority of samples.	2016
26042423	Differential Epigenetic Effects of Atmospheric Cold Plasma on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 Breast Cancer Cells.	Cold atmospheric plasma (plasma) has emerged as a novel tool for a cancer treatment option, having been successfully applied to a few types of cancer cells, as well as tissues. However, to date, no studies have been performed to examine the effect of plasma on epigenetic alterations, including CpG methylation. In this study, the effects of plasma on DNA methylation changes in breast cancer cells were examined by treating cultured MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, representing estrogen-positive and estrogen-negative cancer cells, respectively, with plasma. A pyrosequencing analysis of Alu indicated that a specific CpG site was induced to be hypomethylated from 23.4 to 20.3% (p < 0.05) by plasma treatment in the estrogen-negative MDA-MB-231 cells only. A genome-wide methylation analysis identified "cellular movement, connective tissue development and function, tissue development" and "cell-to-cell signaling and interaction, cell death and survival, cellular development" as the top networks. Of the two cell types, the MDA-MB-231 cells underwent a higher rate of apoptosis and a decreased proliferation rate upon plasma treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that plasma induces epigenetic and cellular changes in a cell type-specific manner, suggesting that a careful screening of target cells and tissues is necessary for the potential application of plasma as a cancer treatment option.	2015
26034301	Culturing primary mouse pancreatic ductal cells.	The most common subtype of pancreatic cancer is pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). PDAC resembles ductal cells morphologically. To study pancreatic ductal cell (PDC) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN)/PDAC biology, it is essential to have reliable in vitro culture conditions. Here we describe a methodology to isolate, culture, and passage PDCs and duct-like cells from the mouse pancreas. It can be used to isolate cells from genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs), providing a valuable tool to study disease models in vitro to complement in vivo findings. The culture conditions allow epithelial cells to outgrow fibroblast and other "contaminating" cell types within a few passages. However, the resulting cultures, although mostly epithelial, are not completely devoid of fibroblasts. Regardless, this protocol provides guidelines for a robust in vitro culture system to isolate, maintain, and expand primary pancreatic ductal epithelial cells. It can be applied to virtually all GEMMs of pancreatic disease and other diseases and cancers that arise from ductal structures. Because most carcinomas resemble ductal structures, this protocol has utility in the study of other cancers in addition to PDAC, such as breast and prostate cancers.	2015
26025665	Presence of insulin-like growth factor binding proteins correlates with tumor-promoting effects of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in breast cancer.	The stroma of breast cancer can promote the disease's progression, but whether its composition and functions are shared among different subtypes is poorly explored. We compared stromal components of a luminal [mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu] and a triple-negative/basal-like [C3(1)-Simian virus 40 large T antigen (Tag)] genetically engineered breast cancer mouse model. The types of cytokines and their expression levels were very different in the two models, as was the extent of innate immune cell infiltration; however, both models showed infiltration of innate immune cells that expressed matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), an extracellular protease linked to the progression of many types of cancer. By intercrossing with Mmp9 null mice, we found that the absence of MMP9 delayed tumor onset in the C3(1)-Tag model but had no effect on tumor onset in the MMTV-Neu model. We discovered that protein levels of insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), an MMP9 substrate, were increased in C3(1)-Tag;Mmp9(-/-) compared to C3(1)-Tag;Mmp9(+/+) tumors. In contrast, IGFBP-1 protein expression was low in MMTV-Neu tumors regardless of Mmp9 status. IGFBP-1 binds and antagonizes IGFs, preventing them from activating their receptors to promote cell proliferation and survival. Tumors from C3(1)-Tag;Mmp9(-/-) mice had reduced IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation, consistent with slower tumor onset. Finally, gene expression analysis of human breast tumors showed that high expression of IGFBP mRNA was strongly correlated with good prognosis but not when MMP9 mRNA was also highly expressed. In conclusion, MMP9 has different effects on breast cancer progression depending on whether IGFBPs are expressed.	2015
26002985	Improved frozen section examination of the retroareolar margin for prediction of nipple involvement in breast cancer.	In this prospective ex vivo study, we propose a new technique for the intraoperative examination of retroareolar tissue and describe both surgical excision and pathological methods. We performed a nipple-sparing mastectomy simulation in patients selected to total mastectomy, in order to evaluate the accuracy of these new technique.	A total of 158 total mastectomy specimens from patients affected by ductal carcinoma in situ (n = 15) or invasive ductal carcinoma (stages I, II, or IIIA) (n = 143) were examined. To obtain the entire sample area, the terminal retroareolar milk duct bunch was isolated. Fragments approximately 1.5 cm in length were excised and sectioned in parallel at the base of the nipple using a cold bistoury. Three transverse histological sections (4 μm each) at 200 μm intervals that included the entire isolated fragments were subjected to frozen section examination. The sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and were evaluated. The remainder of each fragment was embedded in paraffin and 4 μm sections were subsequently stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined.	There were two false-negative (1.3%) and five false-positive (3.1%) findings among the frozen and paraffin sections analyzed. A statistical analysis of the frozen section examinations showed a sensitivity of 92.0%, a specificity of 96.2%, a positive predictive value of 82.1%, a negative predictive value of 98.4%, and an accuracy of 95.4%.	The frozen section examination technique described here detected nipple involvement in breast cancer with greater accuracy than the frozen section usually performed by most surgeons.	2015
25975431	New fluorinated fructose analogs as selective probes of the hexose transporter protein GLUT5.	Facilitated hexose transporters (GLUTs) mediate the transport of hexoses and other substrates across the membranes of numerous cell types, and while some are expressed ubiquitously (e.g., GLUT1), others are more tissue specific (e.g., GLUT5). These properties have been exploited for the imaging of cancer cells by the use of hexose based probes, including fluorinated hexose derivatives for use with positron emission tomography (PET). However, design of new probes has been hampered by a limited understanding of how GLUT transporters interact with their substrates at the molecular level. Two fluorinated fructose surrogates designed for uptake by the GLUT5 transporter are described here: 3-deoxy-3-fluoro-D-fructose (3-FDF) and 1-deoxy-1-fluoro-2,5-anhydromannitol (1-FDAM). Synthesis (both cold and radiolabeled) and in vitro analysis of their transport characteristics in two breast cancer cell lines (EMT-6 and MCF-7) expressing GLUT5 are detailed. Both analogues are readily taken up into both cancer cell lines, with uptake mediated primarily by GLUT5. They also have low IC50 values, indicating a high affinity for the transporter, suggesting that the uptake of these probes would be unaffected by endogenously circulating fructose. Selective uptake by GLUT5 was also demonstrated in Xenopus oocytes. Finally, these results are the first demonstration that a hexose existing predominantly in the pyranose ring structure (3-FDF) is transported by GLUT5, strongly suggesting that this transporter can handle both furanose and pyranose forms of fructose.	2015
25932533	An indigenous single-vial kit formulation of human serum albumin nanocolloid for use in sentinel lymph node detection.	In-situ sentinel lymph node (SLN) detection is an important component in staging cancers of various origins. At present, technetium-99m (Tc)-labeled nanoparticle formulations like sulfur colloid and human serum albumin (HSA) nanocolloid are used in the clinic as SLN tracers. In India, HSA nanocolloid cold kits have so far been imported. This study aims to develop and evaluate an indigenous alternative to imported HSA nanocolloid cold kits for SLN detection/imaging.	Production of cold kits was standardized and the product was characterized for its suitability in terms of particle size. Tc-labeling of an in-house HSA nanocolloid was optimized, and the yield and stability of the product were assessed. Animal studies were performed in Wistar rats using the footpad model. Clinical evaluation was performed in 54 patients using a combination of scintigraphic imaging and a hand-held gamma probe.	With the optimized protocol, HSA nanocolloids with particle sizes ranging from 50 to 200 nm were obtained. Greater than 90% Tc-labeling yield was obtained in 15 min reactions, and the radiopharmaceutical was stable for up to 24 h after preparation. The animal studies showed similar SLN uptake and improved retention pattern compared with those of the imported Nanocoll radiopharmaceutical. Clinical studies showed detectable 'hot' nodes in 53 of 54 patients, demonstrating sensitivity of the product for clinical utility. In conclusion, this indigenous HSA nanocolloid cold kit is proposed as a logistically favorable alternative to imported kits for SLN detection in the Indian clinical scenario.	2015
25928068	Oxaliplatin-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy via TRPA1 Stimulation in Mice Dorsal Root Ganglion Is Correlated with Aluminum Accumulation.	Oxaliplatin is a platinum-based anticancer drug used to treat metastatic colorectal, breast, and lung cancers. While oxaliplatin kills cancer cells effectively, it exhibits several side effects of varying severity. Neuropathic pain is commonly experienced during treatment with oxaliplatin. Patients describe symptoms of paresthesias or dysesthesias that are triggered by cold (acute neuropathy), or as abnormal sensory or motor function (chronic neuropathy). In particular, we found that aluminum levels were relatively high in some cancer patients suffering from neuropathic pain based on clinical observations. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that aluminum accumulation in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in the course of oxaliplatin treatment exacerbates neuropathic pain. In mice injected with oxaliplatin (three cycles of 3 mg/kg i.p. daily for 5 days, followed by 5 days of rest), we detected cold allodynia using the acetone test, but not heat hyperalgesia using a hot plate. However, co-treatment with aluminum chloride (AlCl3∙6H2O; 7 mg/kg i.p. for 14 days: equivalent 0.78 mg/kg of elemental Al) and oxaliplatin (1 cycle of 3 mg/kg i.p. daily for 5 days, followed by 5 days of rest) synergistically induced cold allodynia as well as increased TRPAl mRNA and protein expression. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis showed a significant increase in aluminum concentrations in the DRG of mice treated with aluminum chloride and oxaliplatin compared to aluminum chloride alone. Similarly, in a mouse induced-tumor model, aluminum concentrations were increased in DRG tissue and tumor cells after oxaliplatin treatment. Taken together, these findings suggest that aluminum accumulation in the DRG may exacerbate neuropathic pain in oxaliplatin-treated mice.	2015
25897081	Protein-tyrosine Phosphatase and Kinase Specificity in Regulation of SRC and Breast Tumor Kinase.	Despite significant evidence to the contrary, the view that phosphatases are "nonspecific" still pervades the field. Systems biology approaches to defining how signal transduction pathways are integrated at the level of whole organisms also often downplay the contribution of phosphatases, defining them as "erasers" that serve merely to restore the system to its basal state. Here, we present a study that counteracts the idea of "nonspecific phosphatases." We have characterized two structurally similar and functionally related kinases, BRK and SRC, which are regulated by combinations of activating autophosphorylation and inhibitory C-terminal sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. We demonstrated specificity at the level of the kinases in that SRMS phosphorylated the C terminus of BRK, but not SRC; in contrast, CSK is the kinase responsible for C-terminal phosphorylation of SRC, but not BRK. For the phosphatases, we observed that RNAi-mediated suppression of PTP1B resulted in opposing effects on the activity of BRK and SRC and have defined the mechanisms underlying this specificity. PTP1B inhibited BRK by directly dephosphorylating the Tyr-342 autophosphorylation site. In contrast, PTP1B potentiated SRC activity, but not by dephosphorylating SRC itself directly; instead, PTP1B regulated the interaction between CBP/PAG and CSK. SRC associated with, and phosphorylated, the transmembrane protein CBP/PAG at Tyr-317, resulting in CSK recruitment. We identified PAG as a substrate of PTP1B, and dephosphorylation abolished recruitment of the inhibitory kinase CSK. Overall, these findings illustrate how the combinatorial effects of PTKs and PTPs may be integrated to regulate signaling, with both classes of enzymes displaying exquisite specificity.	2015
25888080	Cytotoxicity and sub-acute toxicity in Crl:CD (SD) rats of traditional herbal formula Ojeok-san.	Although Ojeok-san (OJS), an oriental herbal formula, has been used in Asian countries including Korea, China and Japan to treat the common cold and illnesses including fatigue and gastrointestinal disorders, there is little information of its safety and toxicity in vivo and in vitro.	In the present study, we investigated oral toxicity of OJS over 4 weeks through repeated administration to Crl:CD (SD) rats and its cytotoxicity against various cells as a part of safety evaluation. Animals were given a daily gavage treatment of OJS in daily dosages of 0, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Cytotoxicity assay was conducted at various concentrations in 23 different cell lines including neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, hepatocarcinoma, melanoma, leukemia, colon cancer, breast cancer, keratinocytes, phechromocytoma, prostate cancer, bronchial epithelial cells, and gastric adenocarcinoma.	OJS did not induce significant changes in mortality, food consumption, organ weights, hematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis, except for decrease in number of white blood cells over 1000 mg/kg/day female group. Thus, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) is more than 2000 mg/kg/day for male and 500 mg/kg/day for female rats. In addition, OJS had no cytotoxicity against all tested cells.	Collectively, our data indicate that OJS may be a safe drug although additional studies in the near future will be required before clinical trials can be taken.	2015
25887545	Long non-coding RNA expression profiles predict metastasis in lymph node-negative breast cancer independently of traditional prognostic markers.	Patients with clinically and pathologically similar breast tumors often have very different outcomes and treatment responses. Current prognostic markers allocate the majority of breast cancer patients to the high-risk group, yielding high sensitivities in expense of specificities below 20%, leading to considerable overtreatment, especially in lymph node-negative patients. Seventy percent would be cured by surgery and radiotherapy alone in this group. Thus, precise and early indicators of metastasis are highly desirable to reduce overtreatment. Previous prognostic RNA-profiling studies have only focused on the protein-coding part of the genome, however the human genome contains thousands of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and this unexplored field possesses large potential for identification of novel prognostic markers.	We evaluated lncRNA microarray data from 164 primary breast tumors from adjuvant naïve patients with a mean follow-up of 18 years. Eighty two patients who developed detectable distant metastasis were compared to 82 patients where no metastases were diagnosed. For validation, we determined the prognostic value of the lncRNA profiles by comparing the ability of the profiles to predict metastasis in two additional, previously-published, cohorts.	We showed that lncRNA profiles could distinguish metastatic patients from non-metastatic patients with sensitivities above 90% and specificities of 64-65%. Furthermore; classifications were independent of traditional prognostic markers and time to metastasis.	To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the prognostic potential of lncRNA profiles. Our study suggest that lncRNA profiles provide additional prognostic information and may contribute to the identification of early breast cancer patients eligible for adjuvant therapy, as well as early breast cancer patients that could avoid unnecessary systemic adjuvant therapy. This study emphasizes the potential role of lncRNAs in breast cancer prognosis.	2015
25855289	A model of breast cancer heterogeneity reveals vascular mimicry as a driver of metastasis.	Cancer metastasis requires that primary tumour cells evolve the capacity to intravasate into the lymphatic system or vasculature, and extravasate into and colonize secondary sites. Others have demonstrated that individual cells within complex populations show heterogeneity in their capacity to form secondary lesions. Here we develop a polyclonal mouse model of breast tumour heterogeneity, and show that distinct clones within a mixed population display specialization, for example, dominating the primary tumour, contributing to metastatic populations, or showing tropism for entering the lymphatic or vasculature systems. We correlate these stable properties to distinct gene expression profiles. Those clones that efficiently enter the vasculature express two secreted proteins, Serpine2 and Slpi, which were necessary and sufficient to program these cells for vascular mimicry. Our data indicate that these proteins not only drive the formation of extravascular networks but also ensure their perfusion by acting as anticoagulants. We propose that vascular mimicry drives the ability of some breast tumour cells to contribute to distant metastases while simultaneously satisfying a critical need of the primary tumour to be fed by the vasculature. Enforced expression of SERPINE2 and SLPI in human breast cancer cell lines also programmed them for vascular mimicry, and SERPINE2 and SLPI were overexpressed preferentially in human patients that had lung-metastatic relapse. Thus, these two secreted proteins, and the phenotype they promote, may be broadly relevant as drivers of metastatic progression in human cancer.	2015
25833843	Homologous recombination and human health: the roles of BRCA1, BRCA2, and associated proteins.	Homologous recombination (HR) is a major pathway for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells, the defining step of which is homologous strand exchange directed by the RAD51 protein. The physiological importance of HR is underscored by the observation of genomic instability in HR-deficient cells and, importantly, the association of cancer predisposition and developmental defects with mutations in HR genes. The tumor suppressors BRCA1 and BRCA2, key players at different stages of HR, are frequently mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers. Other HR proteins, including PALB2 and RAD51 paralogs, have also been identified as tumor suppressors. This review summarizes recent findings on BRCA1, BRCA2, and associated proteins involved in human disease with an emphasis on their molecular roles and interactions.	2015
25793887	Validation of a rapid and sensitive LC-MS/MS method for determination of exemestane and its metabolites, 17β-hydroxyexemestane and 17β-hydroxyexemestane-17-O-β-D-glucuronide: application to human pharmacokinetics study.	A novel, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the evaluation of exemestane pharmacokinetics and its metabolites, 17β-dihydroexemestane (active metabolite) and 17β-dihydroexemestane-17-O-β-D-glucuronide (inactive metabolite) in human plasma. Their respective D3 isotopes were used as internal standards. Chromatographic separation of analytes was achieved using Thermo Fisher BDS Hypersil C18 analytic HPLC column (100 × 2.1 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase was delivered at a rate of 0.5 mL/min by gradient elution with 0.1% aqueous formic acid and acetonitrile. The column effluents were detected by API 4000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using electrospray ionisation (ESI) and monitored by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive mode. Mass transitions 297 > 121 m/z, 300 > 121 m/z, 299 > 135 m/z, 302 > 135 m/z, 475 > 281 m/z, and 478 > 284 m/z were monitored for exemestane, exemestane-d3, 17β-dihydroexemestane, 17β-dihydroexemestane-d3, 17β-dihydroexemestane-17-O-β-D-glucuronide, and 17β-dihydroexemestane-17-O-β-D-glucuronide-d3 respectively. The assay demonstrated linear ranges of 0.4-40.0 ng/mL, for exemestane; and 0.2-15.0 ng/mL, for 17β-dihydroexemestane and 17β-dihydroexemestane-17-O-β-D-glucuronide, with coefficient of determination (r2) of > 0.998. The precision (coefficient of variation) were ≤10.7%, 7.7% and 9.5% and the accuracies ranged from 88.8 to 103.1% for exemestane, 98.5 to 106.1% for 17β-dihydroexemestane and 92.0 to 103.2% for 17β-dihydroexemestane-17-O-β-D-glucuronide. The method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetics/dynamics study in breast cancer patients receiving exemestane 25 mg daily orally. For a representative patient, 20.7% of exemestane in plasma was converted into 17β-dihydroexemestane and 29.0% of 17β-dihydroexemestane was inactivated as 17β-dihydroexemestane-17-O-β-D-glucuronide 24 hours after ingestion of exemestane, suggesting that altered 17-dihydroexemestane glucuronidation may play an important role in determining effect of exemestane against breast cancer cells.	2015
25749072	Efficacy of Scalp Cooling in Preventing Chemotherapy-Induced Alopecia in Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Adjuvant Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide Chemotherapy.	Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) is a distressing adverse effect of many chemotherapy agents. The TC (docetaxel [Taxotere] and cyclophosphamide) chemotherapy regimen is typically associated with complete alopecia. Scalp cooling with cold caps has been reported to minimize or prevent CIA. We conducted a prospective study to assess efficacy of scalp cooling in preventing CIA among women receiving adjuvant TC chemotherapy for breast cancer.	Women at the Weill Cornell Breast Center who independently elected to use scalp cooling with cold caps during adjuvant TC chemotherapy were asked to participate. Degree of hair loss was assessed by a single practitioner using Dean's alopecia scale (grade 1/excellent [< 25% hair loss], grade 2/good [25%-50% hair loss], grade 3/moderate [50%-75% hair loss], grade 4/poor [> 75% hair loss]), by digital photographs, and by patient self-report of hair thinning or the need to wear a wig/head covering, or both. Assessments were made before each chemotherapy treatment and at follow-up visits between 3 weeks and 3 months after completion of chemotherapy.	Of 20 evaluable patients, 10% reported a need to wear a wig/head covering at the follow-up visit. Dean's alopecia score was excellent for 65% of patients, good for 25% of patients, and moderate or poor for 10% of patients. The majority of patients reported hair thinning after every chemotherapy cycle. No patient discontinued therapy because of an intolerance to cold caps.	Scalp cooling with cold caps appears to be effective in preventing CIA among the majority of women undergoing treatment with TC chemotherapy.	2015
25748228	Synthesis and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of an (18)F-labeled neuropeptide Y analogue for imaging of breast cancer by PET.	Imaging of Y1R expression in breast cancer is still a challenging task. Herein, we report a suitable (18)F-labeled high-molecular-weight glycopeptide for imaging of peripheral neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y1 receptor (Y1R)-positive tumors by preclinical small-animal positron emission tomography (PET). The Y1R-preferring NPY [F(7),P(34)]NPY analogue was functionalized with an alkyne-bearing propargylglycine (Pra) in position 4. The corresponding fluoroglycosylated (FGlc) peptide analogue [Pra(4)(FGlc),F(7),P(34)]NPY and its (18)F-labeled analogue were synthesized by click chemistry-based fluoroglycosylation. The radiosynthesis was performed by (18)F-fluoroglycosylation starting from the 2-triflate of the β-mannosylazide and the alkyne peptide [Pra(4),F(7),P(34)]NPY. The radiosynthesis of the(18)F-labeled analogue was optimized using a minimum amount of peptide precursor (40 nmol), proceeding with an overall radiochemical yield of 20-25% (nondecay corrected) in a total synthesis time of 75 min with specific activities of 40-70 GBq/μmol. In comparison to NPY and [F(7),P(34)]NPY, in vitro Y1R and Y2R activation studies with the cold [Pra(4)(FGlc),F(7),P(34)]NPY on stably transfected COS-7 cells displayed a high potency for the induction of Y1R-specific inositol accumulation (pEC50 = 8.5 ± 0.1), whereas the potency at Y2R was significantly decreased. Internalization studies on stably transfected HEK293 cells confirmed a strong glycopeptide-mediated Y1R internalization and a substantial Y1R subtype selectivity over Y2R. In vitro autoradiography with Y1R-positive MCF-7 tumor tissue slices indicated high specific binding of the (18)F-labeled glycopeptide, when binding was reduced by 95% ([Pra(4),F(7),P(34)]NPY) and by 86% (BIBP3226 Y1R antagonist) in competition studies. Biodistribution and small-animal PET studies on MCF-7 breast tumor-bearing nude mice revealed radiotracer uptake in the MCF-7 tumor of 1.8%ID/g at 20 min p.i. and 0.7%ID/g at 120 min p.i. (n = 3-4), increasing tumor-to-blood ratios from 1.2 to 2.4, and a tumor retention of 76 ± 4% (n = 4; 45-90 min p.i.). PET imaging studies with MCF-7 tumor-bearing nude mice demonstrated uptake of the (18)F-labeled glycopeptide in the tumor region at 60 min p.i., whereas only negligible tumor uptake was observed in animals injected with a nonbinding (18)F-labeled glycopeptide pendant as a measure of nonspecific binding. In conclusion, PET imaging experiments with the (18)F-labeled NPY glycopeptide revealed Y1R-specific binding uptake in MCF-7 tumors in vivo together with decreased kidney uptake compared to DOTA-derivatives of this peptide. We consider this glycopeptide to be a potent lead peptide for the design of improved (18)F-glycopeptides with shorter amino acid sequences that would further facilitate PET imaging studies of Y1R-positive breast tumors.	2015
25730369	Critical roles of specimen type and temperature before and during fixation in the detection of phosphoproteins in breast cancer tissues.	The most efficient approach for therapy selection to inhibit the deregulated kinases in cancer tissues is to measure their phosphorylation status prior to the treatment. The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of pre-analytical parameters (cold ischemia time, temperature before and during tissue fixation, and sample type) on the levels of proteins and phosphoproteins in breast cancer tissues, focusing on the PI3 kinase/AKT pathway. The BALB-neuT mouse breast cancer model expressing HER2 and pAKT proteins and human biopsy and resection specimens were analyzed. By using quantitative reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA), 9 proteins and 16 phosphoproteins relevant to breast cancer biology were assessed. Cold temperatures before and during fixation resulted in a marked improvement in the preservation of the reactivity of biological markers (eg, ER, HER2) in general and, specifically, pHER2 and pAKT. Some phosphoproteins, eg, pHER2 and pAKT, were more sensitive to prolonged cold ischemia times than others (eg, pS6RP and pSTAT5). By comparing the phosphoprotein levels in core needle biopsies with those in resection specimens, we found a marked decrease in many phosphoproteins in the latter. Cold conditions can improve the preservation of proteins and phosphoproteins in breast cancer tissues. Biopsies ≤ 1 mm in size are the preferred sample type for assessing the activity of deregulated kinases for personalized cancer treatments because the phosphoprotein levels are better preserved compared with resection specimens. Each potential new (phospho)protein biomarker should be tested for its sensitivity to pre-analytical processing prior to the development of a diagnostic assay.	2015
25686829	Role of microRNA221 in regulating normal mammary epithelial hierarchy and breast cancer stem-like cells.	Increasing evidence suggests that lineage specific subpopulations and stem-like cells exist in normal and malignant breast tissues. Epigenetic mechanisms maintaining this hierarchical homeostasis remain to be investigated. In this study, we found the level of microRNA221 (miR-221) was higher in stem-like and myoepithelial cells than in luminal cells isolated from normal and malignant breast tissue. In normal breast cells, over-expression of miR-221 generated more myoepithelial cells whereas knock-down of miR-221 increased luminal cells. Over-expression of miR-221 stimulated stem-like cells in luminal type of cancer and the miR-221 level was correlated with clinical outcome in breast cancer patients. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was induced by overexpression of miR-221 in normal and breast cancer cells. The EMT related gene ATXN1 was found to be a miR-221 target gene regulating breast cell hierarchy. In conclusion, we propose that miR-221 contributes to lineage homeostasis of normal and malignant breast epithelium.	2015
25681440	A novel phosphatidic acid-protein-tyrosine phosphatase D2 axis is essential for ERBB2 signaling in mammary epithelial cells.	We used a loss-of-function screen to investigate the role of classical protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in three-dimensional mammary epithelial cell morphogenesis and ERBB2 signaling. The study revealed a novel role for PTPD2 as a positive regulator of ERBB2 signaling. Suppression of PTPD2 attenuated the ERBB2-induced multiacinar phenotype in three-dimensional cultures specifically by inhibiting ERBB2-mediated loss of polarity and lumen filling. In contrast, overexpression of PTPD2 enhanced the ERBB2 phenotype. We also found that a lipid second messenger, phosphatidic acid, bound PTPD2 in vitro and enhanced its catalytic activity. Small molecule inhibitors of phospholipase D (PLD), an enzyme that produces phosphatidic acid in cells, also attenuated the ERBB2 phenotype. Exogenously added phosphatidic acid rescued the PLD-inhibition phenotype, but only when PTPD2 was present. These findings illustrate a novel pathway involving PTPD2 and the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid that promotes ERBB2 function.	2015
25679164	Comparing the monoisocentric and dual isocentric techniques in chest wall radiotherapy of mastectomy patients.	The monoisocentric (MIT) and dual isocentric (DIT) techniques are compared for the mastectomy patients undergoing chest wall radiotherapy, and a new practical method is suggested for determining the dose calculation reference point to be used in the MIT. Data of 18 mastectomy patients having chest wall radiotherapy were used. To find the appropriate dose calculation reference point for the MIT, the target tissue was divided into nine regions with 17 points as the appropriate candidates. After finding the best reference point for the MIT, dose calculations were made for each patient based on the MIT and DIT to determine the dose distributions of the target volume and organs at risk. The lateral component of the dose calculation reference point was found to be located at one-third of the distance between the geometrical center and the lateral border of the chest wall in the lateral direction toward the outer border. The longitudinal component of this point was found to be located at the geometrical center of the chest wall with a depth located around 2-3 cm under the patients' skin. There was no significant difference between the two radiotherapy planning techniques (MIT and DIT) regarding the dose distributions in the organs at risk and the 95% of the prescribed dose coverage of the target tissue. However, a significant difference for the 105% of the prescribed dose coverage, maximum dose delivered to the target tissue, and the level 2 lymph nodes dose was found, with the DIT showing higher values. Because of the good matching and no superposition observed between the treatment fields in the MIT, it was expected and confirmed that the hot and cold regions (with higher and lower doses than the prescribed dose) with the MIT are significantly fewer than that of the DIT. Therefore, to perform a better conformal radiotherapy for the patients having mastectomy, it could be recommended to use the MIT instead of the DIT and other conventional techniques.	2015
25635828	Fever-range hyperthermia vs. hypothermia effect on cancer cell viability, proliferation and HSP90 expression.	The current study examines the effect of fever-range hyperthermia and mild hypothermia on human cancer cells focusing on cell viability, proliferation and HSP90 expression.	A549 and H1299 lung carcinoma, MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma, U87MG and T98G glioblastoma, DU145 and PC3 prostate carcinoma and MRC5 normal fetal lung fibroblasts cell lines were studied. After 3-day exposure to 34°C, 37°C and 40°C, cell viability was determined. Cell proliferation (ki67 index), apoptosis (Caspase 9) and HSP90 expression was studied by confocal microscopy.	Viability/proliferation experiments demonstrated that MRC5 fibroblasts were extremely sensitive to hyperthermia, while they were the most resistant to hypothermia. T98G and A549 were thermo-tolerant, the remaining being thermo-sensitive to a varying degree. Nonetheless, as a universal effect, hypothermia reduced viability/proliferation in all cell lines. Hyperthermia sharply induced Caspase 9 in the U87MG most thermo-sensitive cell line. In T98G and A549 thermo-tolerant cell lines, the levels of Caspase 9 declined. Moreover, hyperthermia strongly induced the HSP90 levels in T98G, whilst a sharp decrease was recorded in the thermo-sensitive PC3 and U87MG cell lines. Hyperthermia sensitized thermo-sensitive cancer cell lines to cisplatin and temozolomide, whilst its sensitizing effect was diminished in thermo-tolerant cell lines.	The existence of thermo-tolerant and thermo-sensitive cancer cell lines was confirmed, which further encourages research to classify human tumor thermic predilection for patient stratification in clinical trials. Of interest, mild hypothermia had a universal suppressing effect on cancer cell proliferation, further supporting the radio-sensitization hypothesis through reduction of oxygen and metabolic demands.	2015
25612952	[Acrometastasis from breast cancer after the use of frozen gloves by adjuvant chemotherapy].	A woman was referred to adjuvant chemotherapy after radical mastectomy. Frozen gloves were used to prevent onycholysis and neurotoxicity. Because of rapid progression of the cancer she received palliative chemotherapy. Shortly after she presented with growing subungual inflammation, first suspected to be a felon, but later diagnosed as a metastasis. Acrometastasis is very rare and is often mistaken for infection. The learning point is to consider acrometastasis when treatment for felon fails in patients with a history of cancer. A possible relationship between frozen gloves and acrometastasis cannot be excluded.	2015
25574572	Seasonal variability in the incidence of carcinomatous meningitis.	The aim of the study was to investigate whether there are seasonal differences in the occurrence of carcinomatous meningitis (CM), with a greater prevalence of the disease in months with higher temperatures.	The authors searched the records of all patients with a diagnosis of CM from 1998 until 2013 at the University Hospital of Patras, Greece. The date of hospitalization was extracted for each patient. The cases were divided into 2 categories depending on the time of CM diagnosis. Based on the official data regarding the annual temperature distribution in this region, the authors divided the patients into 2 groups. The first group consisted of cases diagnosed with CM from October 15 to April 15 (cold climate and shorter daytime duration), whereas the second group comprised patients diagnosed between April 15 and October 15 (warm climate and longer daytime duration).	Overall, 44 confirmed cases of CM were found. The most common type of malignancy associated with the development of CM was breast cancer (27 patients), while the second most common tumor was lung carcinoma (11 patients). The median interval between the time of initial cancer diagnosis and CM was 4.5 years. Thirty-one patients were diagnosed with CM during the period between April 15 and October 15, while the remaining 13 patients developed CM between October 15 and April 15, a significant difference (p = 0.01).	Significantly more patients developed CM during the warm season of the year. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence for the potential seasonal variability in CM incidence. However, these results should be validated prospectively in larger cohorts.	2015
25553709	Cancer-specific chemoprevention and anti-metastatic potentials of Rheum emodi rhizome ethyl acetate extracts and identification of active principles through HPLC and GC-MS analysis.	Rheum emodi Wall. ex Meissn. (Polygonaceae) is a Himalayan perennial herb which has been cultivated over 5000 years for its medicinal properties by rural and tribal people of Kashmir, and has great significance for its traditional use in Ayurvedic, Unani and folk systems of medicine for cancer treatments. However, there is lack of reports pertaining to specific-chemopreventive properties of R. emodi rhizome. The present study investigates R. emodi rhizome hot and cold ethyl acetate extracts (EHR and ECR) for specific-chemopreventive properties. The extracts were found to be effective antioxidant sources, and showed significant (P<0.05) cancer-specific cytotoxicity towards MDA-MB-231 cells (when compared to WRL-68 [non-tumoral cells]) with IC(50) values of 56.59±1.29 μg/ml (EHR) and 152.38±1.45 μg/ml (ECR) respectively, and induced apoptosis significantly (P<0.05) high in MDA-MB-231 cells (estrogen receptor-(ER)-negative) when compared to MCF-7 cells (ER-positive). Extracts also demonstrated evident anti-metastatic activity. Further, the extracts were chemically characterized through HPLC analysis which revealed major polyphenolics and the GC-MS analysis of the effective extract EHR unveiled (Methyl 6,7-dideoxy-6-C-methyl-2,3-di-O-methyl-à-D-gluco-oct-6-eno-1,5-pyranosid)urono-8,4-lactone,Chrysophanol, derivatives of cyclopropanes and a quinazoline derivative. Overall, EHR exhibited significantly better results on par with ECR, and thus could be considered for their use in designing cancer-specific chemopreventive agents against ER-negative breast cancer.	2015
25553378	Andrographolide and analogues in cancer prevention.	Andrographis paniculata is a medicinal plant traditionally used for treatment of cough and cold, fever, laryngitis, and several infectious diseases. Extracts of A. paniculata have shown versatile potency against various diseases including cancer. The active biomolecules of A. paniculata mainly are lactone and diterpene. Andrographolide and analogues have been widely used for prevention of different diseases. Andrographolides have shown potent antiinflammatory and anticancer activities. It showed potentials as chemopreventive agents by suppressing growth of cancer cells by inhibiting NF-kappaB, PI3K/AKT and other kinase pathways and by inducing apoptosis. Andrographolide induced both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathway in different cancer cells via expression of different anti-apoptotic protein like Bax, p53, and activated caspases. Andrographolide was successfully used as an antineoplastic drug in cancer chemotherapy. Andrographolide inhibited the growth of human breast, prostate, and hepatoma tumors. Andrographolide and analogues need to be subjected to further clinical and biomedical studies in cancer chemoprevention. Andrographolide could be potent anticancer agent when used in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents.	2015
25512156	Screening for cancer in low- and middle-income countries.	Screening programs involve testing asymptomatic individuals with an accurate screening test to identify those likely to have the disease of interest and to further investigate them to confirm or exclude the disease. The aim of cancer screening is to prevent cancer deaths and improve quality of life by finding cancers early and by effectively treating them. A decision to introduce a screening program in public health services depends on the evidence that the benefits outweigh the harms of screening, disease burden, availability of suitable screening test, effective treatment, adequate resources, and efficient health services. Screening programs should achieve high participation for testing, diagnosis, and treatment to be effective and efficient.	To describe the current status of cancer screening programs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).	A review of literature and on-going cancer screening initiatives in LMICs was made to discuss cancer screening in these countries.	Although population-based programs offering Papanicolaou testing every 3 to 5 years have reduced cervical cancer incidence and mortality in high-income countries, such programs have been less successful in reducing cervical cancer burden in LMICs due to poor organization, lack of coverage, and lack of quality assurance. The challenges in introducing high-quality cytology screening in LMICs have led to evaluation of alternative screening approaches such as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), human papillomavirus (HPV) testing-based screening, and novel paradigms such as a "single-visit screen and treat" in which treatment with cryotherapy or cold coagulation is provided to screen-positive women without clinical evidence of cancer. Both HPV testing and VIA have been found to prevent cervical neoplasia and cervical cancer deaths in clinical trials. Although mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality, associated overdiagnosis and overtreatment and the balance between benefits and harms have received much attention in recent years. Although introduction of clinical breast examination screening in LMICs should wait for evidence from ongoing trials, improving breast awareness and access to early diagnosis and treatment in health services is a valuable breast cancer control option in LMICs. Organized colorectal cancer screening programs are still evolving and are in early stages of development in many high-income countries. To date, there is insufficient evidence to support the introduction of population-based stomach, lung, ovarian, and prostate cancer screening in public health services.	Implementation of VIA screening in several LMICs is conducive to future HPV screening programs when affordable HPV tests become widely available. Both HPV vaccination and HPV screening have a huge potential to eliminate cervical cancer in LMICs. A mammography screening program is a complex undertaking involving substantial resources and infrastructure that may not be feasible in many LMICs.
25447286	Conditional knockout mouse models of cancer.	In 2007, three scientists, Drs. Mario R. Capecchi, Martin J. Evans, and Oliver Smithies, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their contributions of introducing specific gene modifications into mice. This technology, commonly referred to as gene targeting or knockout, has proven to be a powerful means for precisely manipulating the mammalian genome and has generated great impacts on virtually all phases of mammalian biology and basic biomedical research. Of note, germline mutations of many genes, especially tumor suppressors, often result in lethality during embryonic development or at developmental stages before tumor formation. This obstacle has been effectively overcome by the use of conditional knockout technology in conjunction with Cre-LoxP- or Flp-Frt-mediated temporal and/or spatial systems to generate genetic switches for precise DNA recombination. Currently, numerous conditional knockout mouse models have been successfully generated and applied in studying tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis. This review summarizes some conditional mutant mouse models that are widely used in cancer research and our understanding of the possible mechanisms underlying tumorigenesis.	2014
25432632	Effect of low-level laser therapy on pain and swelling in women with breast cancer-related lymphedema: a systematic review and meta-analysis.	This study aims to examine literature on effectiveness of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in reducing limb volume and pain in adults with breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL).	PubMed, PEDro, CINAHL, and Cochrane databases were searched using (lymphedema OR edema OR swelling) AND (breast cancer OR mastectomy) AND (laser OR low-level laser therapy OR LLLT OR cold laser). Intervention studies or meta-analyses reporting LLLT for BCRL were included in the search. Pooled effect sizes (ES) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for volume and pain. No limitations were placed on length of follow-up, publication year, or language. Final search was conducted on October 16, 2014.	Nine studies met criteria for inclusion. Within-group pooled ES for volume (six studies) was -0.52 (-0.78, -0.25), representing a 75.7-ml reduction in limb volume after LLLT. Between-group pooled ES for volume (four studies) was -0.62 (-0.97, -0.28), representing a 90.9-ml greater reduction in volume with treatment including LLLT versus not including LLLT. Within-group pooled ES for pain reduction (three studies) was -0.62 (-1.06, -0.19), pain reduction of 13.5 mm (0-100 mm VAS). Between-group pooled ES for pain reduction (two studies) was non-significant at -1.21 (-4.51, 2.10).	Moderate-strength evidence supports LLLT in the management of BCRL, with clinically relevant within-group reductions in volume and pain immediately after conclusion of LLLT treatments. Greater reductions in volume were found with the use of LLLT than in treatments without it.	LLLT confers clinically meaningful reductions in arm volume and pain in women with BCRL.	2015
25432487	Structural characterization, antioxidant and anticancer properties of gold nanoparticles synthesized from leaf extract(decoction)of Antigonon leptopus Hook. &Arn.	Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring boiling water over alleviated leaves of the tea plant. Tea prepared from the aerial parts of Antigonon leptopus has been traditionally used as remedy for cold, diabetes and pain in many countries. The gold nanoparticles (Au NPs) synthesized from powdered leaf extract (decoction) of A. leptopus were characterized by UV–visible spectroscopy (UV–vis), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR), high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses to define the formation of Au NPs. Further, the synthesized Au NPs were well characterized based on their strong surface plasmon resonance (SPR), crystalline nature, functional groups, size and dispersed shapes, purity and Bragg's reflections of face centered cubic (fcc) structure of metallic gold. The Au NPs showed higher free radical scavenging property when compared to the effect of leaf extract. Cytotoxicity study of synthesized Au NPs exhibited the growth inhibitory property at the concentration (GI50) of 257.8 μg/mL in human adenocarcinoma breast cancer (MCF-7) cells after 48 h. Thus, the Au NPs synthesized from the Mexican creeper, A. leptopus revealed the important biological properties: as a free radical as well as anticancer agent. We conclude that the A. leptopus derived biological materials have promising potential as a source for the development of anticancer drug in future.	2015
25418580	Preanalytical variables and phosphoepitope expression in FFPE tissue: quantitative epitope assessment after variable cold ischemic time.	Individualized targeted therapies for cancer patients require accurate and reproducible assessment of biomarkers to be able to plan treatment accordingly. Recent studies have shown highly variable effects of preanalytical variables on gene expression profiling and protein levels of different tissue types. Several publications have described protein degradation of tissue samples as a direct result of delay of formalin fixation of the tissue. Phosphorylated proteins are more labile and epitope degradation can happen within 30 min of cold ischemic time. To address this issue, we evaluated the change in antigenicity of a series of phosphoproteins in paraffin-embedded samples from breast tumors as a function of time to formalin fixation. A tissue microarray consisting of 93 breast cancer specimens with documented time-to-fixation was used to evaluate changes in antigenicity of 12 phosphoepitopes frequently used in research settings as a function of cold ischemic time. Analysis was performed in a quantitative manner using the AQUA technology for quantitative immunofluorescence. For each marker, least squares univariate linear regression was performed and confidence intervals were computed using bootstrapping. The majority of the epitopes tested revealed changes in expression levels with increasing time to formalin fixation. Some phosphorylated proteins, such as phospho-HSP27 and phospho-S6 RP, involved in post-translational modification and stress response pathways increased in expression or phosphorylation levels. Others (like phospho-AKT, phosphor-ERK1/2, phospho-Tyrosine, phospho-MET, and others) are quite labile and loss of antigenicity can be reported within 1-2 h of cold ischemic time. Therefore specimen collection should be closely monitored and subjected to quality control measures to ensure accurate measurement of these epitopes. However, a few phosphoepitopes (like phospho-JAK2 and phospho-ER) are sufficiently robust for routine usage in companion diagnostic testing.	2015
25368315	Using the RCAS-TVA system to model human cancer in mice.	For successful infection, avian sarcoma leukosis virus subgroup A (ASLV-A) requires its receptor, tumor virus A (TVA), to be present on the surface of target cells. This is the basis of the RCAS-TVA gene delivery system: Mammalian cells lack the gene encoding TVA and are normally resistant to infection by ASLV; however, transgenic targeting of TVA to specific cell types or tissues in the mouse renders these cells uniquely susceptible to infection by ASLV-A-based RCAS viruses. The RCAS-TVA system is a powerful tool for effectively modeling human tumors, including pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancers, gliomas, and melanomas. RCAS viruses can deliver cDNAs (≤2.8 kb), as well as short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and other noncoding RNAs. Compared with traditional transgenic and knockout mice, the RCAS-TVA system has several strengths. First, virus delivery is generally performed postnatally and results in a relatively low infection rate of target cells; the sporadic postnatal expression of the gene of interest mimics the situation in developing human tumors. Second, a single transgenic mouse line can be used to compare the consequences of specific genes on tumor development, with viruses encoding oncogenes or shRNAs targeting specific tumor suppressor genes. TVA mouse strains can also be easily combined with transgenic, knock-in, and knockout mouse models to study cooperating genetic events.	2014
25350304	[Prevention of skeletal related events in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours].	This article is based on a systematic literature search and meta-analyses of clinical data regarding effects of bisphosphonates (BP) and denosumab (DS) on preventing skeletal related events (SRE) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumours. Although there are pharmacological differences between the different types of BP no major differences were observed between BP in preventing SRE or in adverse events. Treatment with DS has in three randomised trials showed a greater effect than BP in preventing SRE. The optimal choice of bone-anti-resorptive agent should depend on the patient's general condition, renal function and treatment logistics.	2014
25287652	Missing-in-Metastasis regulates cell motility and invasion via PTPδ-mediated changes in SRC activity.	MIM (Missing-in-Metastasis), also known as MTSS1 (metastasis suppressor 1), is a scaffold protein that is down-regulated in multiple metastatic cancer cell lines compared with non-metastatic counterparts. MIM regulates cytoskeletal dynamics and actin polymerization, and has been implicated in the control of cell motility and invasion. MIM has also been shown to bind to a receptor PTP (protein tyrosine phosphatase), PTPδ, an interaction that may provide a link between tyrosine-phosphorylation-dependent signalling and metastasis. We used shRNA-mediated gene silencing to investigate the consequences of loss of MIM on the migration and invasion of the MCF10A mammary epithelial cell model of breast cancer. We observed that suppression of MIM by RNAi enhanced migration and invasion of MCF10A cells, effects that were associated with increased levels of PTPδ. Furthermore, analysis of human clinical data indicated that PTPδ was elevated in breast cancer samples when compared with normal tissue. We demonstrated that the SRC protein tyrosine kinase is a direct substrate of PTPδ and, upon suppression of MIM, we observed changes in the phosphorylation status of SRC; in particular, the inhibitory site (Tyr527) was hypophosphorylated, whereas the activating autophosphorylation site (Tyr416) was hyperphosphorylated. Thus the absence of MIM led to PTPδ-mediated activation of SRC. Finally, the SRC inhibitor SU6656 counteracted the effects of MIM suppression on cell motility and invasion. The present study illustrates that both SRC and PTPδ have the potential to be therapeutic targets for metastatic tumours associated with loss of MIM.	2015
25275485	Thermosensitive and mucoadhesive sol-gel composites of paclitaxel/dimethyl-β-cyclodextrin for buccal delivery.	The purpose of this study was to develop a buccal paclitaxel delivery system using the thermosensitive polymer Pluronic F127 (PF127) and the mucoadhesive polymer polyethylene oxide (PEO). The anticancer agent paclitaxel is usually used to treat ovarian, breast, and non-small-cell lung cancer. To improve its aqueous solubility, paclitaxel was incorporated into an inclusion complex with (2,6-di-O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin (DMβCD). The formation of the paclitaxel inclusion complex was evaluated using various techniques, including x-ray diffractometry (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Hydrogels were prepared using a cold method. Concentrations of 18, 20, and 23% (w/v) PF127 were dissolved in distilled water including paclitaxel and stored overnight in a refrigerator at 4 °C. PEO was added at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1% (w/v). Each formulation included paclitaxel (0.5 mg/mL). The sol-gel transition temperature of the hydrogels was measured using the tube-inverting method. Drug release from the hydrogels was measured using a Franz diffusion cell containing pH 7.4 phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) buffer at 37 °C. The cytotoxicity of each formulation was measured using the MTT assay with a human oral cancer cell (KB cell). The sol-gel transition temperature of the hydrogel decreased when PF127 was present and varied according to the presence of mucoadhesive polymers. The in vitro release was sustained and the release rate was slowed by the addition of the mucoadhesive polymer. The cytotoxicity of the blank formulation was low, although the drug-loaded hydrogel showed acceptable cytotoxicity. The results of our study suggest that the combination of a PF 127-based mucoadhesive hydrogel formulation and inclusion complexes improves the in vitro release and cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel.	2014
25239551	Influence of seasonal variation on Thymus longicaulis C. Presl chemical composition and its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.	Thymus longicaulis C. Presl. (Lamiaceae) is a small aromatic perennial herb typical of the Illyric-Mediterranean flora, traditionally used as remedy for cold, flu, cough, nephritis and abdominal pain. In order to carry out a thorough chemical and biological screening of the plant and to explore phenophases influence on its polyphenol content, samples of the plant were collected at different phases during its life cycle (July/October 2012 and January/April 2013). Each sample, previously extracted using a hydroalcoholic solution, was phytochemically analyzed for its metabolic constitution applying LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS techniques. Although identified metabolites were differently concentrated at the various collection times, T. longicaulis leaf extracts were mainly constituted by low molecular weight phenols, and flavonoids. Rosmarinic acid was found as the main metabolite in Oct12 sample. Chemopreventive efficacy of the investigated extracts, by means of their anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic and antioxidant activities, was assessed. To this purpose, each extract underwent an extensive screening towards five human cell lines: CCRF-CEM (leukemia); U251 (glioblastoma); MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer); HCT-116 (colon cancer) and MRC-5 (lung fibroblasts) through XTT [2,3bis(2-metoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2H tetrazolium hydroxide] test. The ability of the extracts to counteract cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was also evaluated by COX-2 expression assay in human THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages. COX-2 inhibition could represent a valuable anticancer strategy as it is associated with carcinogenesis and over-expressed in a variety of human malignancies. Oct12 extract, which was particularly rich in rosmarinic acid and methylapigenin, exhibited a strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effectiveness.	2014
25239082	How much oxycodone is needed for adequate analgesia after breast cancer surgery: effect of the OPRM1 118A>G polymorphism.	Most clinically used opioids are mu-opioid receptor agonists. Therefore, genetic variation of the OPRM1 gene that encodes the mu-opioid receptor is of great interest for understanding pain management. A polymorphism 118A>G (rs1799971) within the OPRM1 gene results in a missense mutation and affects the function of the receptor. We studied the association between the 118A>G polymorphism and oxycodone analgesia and pain sensitivity in 1,000 women undergoing breast cancer surgery. Preoperatively, experimental cold and heat pain sensitivities were tested. Postoperative pain was assessed at rest and during motion. Intravenous oxycodone analgesia was titrated first by a research nurse and on the ward using a patient-controlled analgesia device. The primary endpoint was the amount of oxycodone needed for the first state of adequate analgesia. For each patient, the 118A>G polymorphism was genotyped using the Sequenom MassARRAY (Sequenom, San Diego, CA). The association between this variant and the pain phenotypes was tested using linear regression. The 118A>G variant was associated significantly with the amount of oxycodone requested for adequate analgesia (P = .003, β = .016). Collectively, oxycodone consumption was highest in individuals having the GG genotype (.16 mg/kg), lowest for those with the AA genotype (.12 mg/kg), and moderate for those having the AG genotype (.13 mg/kg). Furthermore, the G allele was associated with higher postoperative baseline pain ratings (P = .001, β = .44). No evidence of association with other pain phenotypes examined was observed.	This study demonstrates that the OPRM1 118A>G polymorphism was associated with the amount of oxycodone required in the immediate postoperative period. Although a significant factor for determining oxycodone requirement, the 118A>G polymorphism alone explained less than 1% of the variance. No association was found between 118A>G and experimental pain	2014
25217527	MicroRNA100 inhibits self-renewal of breast cancer stem-like cells and breast tumor development.	miRNAs are essential for self-renewal and differentiation of normal and malignant stem cells by regulating the expression of key stem cell regulatory genes. Here, we report evidence implicating the miR100 in self-renewal of cancer stem-like cells (CSC). We found that miR100 expression levels relate to the cellular differentiation state, with lowest expression in cells displaying stem cell markers. Utilizing a tetracycline-inducible lentivirus to elevate expression of miR100 in human cells, we found that increasing miR100 levels decreased the production of breast CSCs. This effect was correlated with an inhibition of cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in mouse tumor xenografts due to attenuated expression of the CSC regulatory genes SMARCA5, SMARCD1, and BMPR2. Furthermore, miR100 induction in breast CSCs immediately upon their orthotopic implantation or intracardiac injection completely blocked tumor growth and metastasis formation. Clinically, we observed a significant association between miR100 expression in breast cancer specimens and patient survival. Our results suggest that miR100 is required to direct CSC self-renewal and differentiation.	2014
25183833	Holliday junction resolvases.	Four-way DNA intermediates, called Holliday junctions (HJs), can form during meiotic and mitotic recombination, and their removal is crucial for chromosome segregation. A group of ubiquitous and highly specialized structure-selective endonucleases catalyze the cleavage of HJs into two disconnected DNA duplexes in a reaction called HJ resolution. These enzymes, called HJ resolvases, have been identified in bacteria and their bacteriophages, archaea, and eukaryotes. In this review, we discuss fundamental aspects of the HJ structure and their interaction with junction-resolving enzymes. This is followed by a brief discussion of the eubacterial RuvABC enzymes, which provide the paradigm for HJ resolvases in other organisms. Finally, we review the biochemical and structural properties of some well-characterized resolvases from archaea, bacteriophage, and eukaryotes.	2014
25084072	Test-retest agreement and reliability of quantitative sensory testing 1 year after breast cancer surgery.	Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is used to assess sensory dysfunction and nerve damage by examining psychophysical responses to controlled, graded stimuli such as mechanical and thermal detection and pain thresholds. In the breast cancer population, 4 studies have used QST to examine persistent pain after breast cancer treatment, suggesting neuropathic pain being a prominent pain mechanism. However, the agreement and reliability of QST has not been described in the postsurgical breast cancer population, hindering exact interpretation of QST studies in this population. The aim of the present study was to assess test-retest properties of QST after breast cancer surgery.	A total of 32 patients recruited from a larger ongoing prospective trial were examined with QST 12 months after breast cancer surgery and reexamined a week later. A standardized QST protocol was used, including sensory mapping for mechanical, warmth and cold areas of sensory dysfunction, mechanical thresholds using monofilaments and pin-prick, thermal thresholds including warmth and cold detection thresholds and heat pain threshold, with bilateral examination. Agreement and reliability were assessed by Bland-Altman plots, descriptive statistics, coefficients of variance, and intraclass correlation.	Bland-Altman plots showed high variation on the surgical side. Intraclass coefficients ranged from 0.356 to 0.847 (moderate to substantial reliability). Between-patient variation was generally higher (0.9 to 14.5 SD) than within-patient variation (0.23 to 3.55 SD). There were no significant differences between pain and pain-free patients. The individual test-retest variability was higher on the operated side compared with the nonoperated side.	The QST protocol reliability allows for group-to-group comparison of sensory function, but less so for individual follow-up after breast cancer surgery.	2015
25081342	Margins: a status report from the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Breast Surgeons.	Since the emergence of breast conserving surgery (BCS) as an alternative to mastectomy in the 1980's, there has been little consensus on what constitutes acceptable margins for cases of invasive breast cancer, how best to evaluate margins in the operating room, or an understanding of the challenging process of margin assessment by pathologists. The program committee for the 15th Annual Meeting of The American Society of Breast Surgeons organized a plenary session to discuss the latest thinking and guidelines for these important issues. The SSO/ASTRO Consensus Guideline on Margins for BCS was an important focus of discussion. The SSO/ASTRO consensus panelists concluded that "no ink on tumor" is an adequate surgical margin for BCS in patients with invasive breast cancers. Intraoperative strategies to decrease the incidence of positive margins include intraoperative localization techniques (wire-localization, ultrasound, radioactive seed) and intraoperative margin assessments with specimen radiography, imprint cytology, and frozen section. Studies also demonstrate the positive effect of shave margins with or without intraoperative margin assessment. The College of American Pathologists protocols for breast specimen margin evaluation consider multiple variables that can impact the proper assessment of margins. These variables include: tissue fixation time, specimen orientation, cold ischemia time, leaking ink, specimen pancaking and others that surgeons need to be aware of. Determining when "enough is enough" should not only be the application of guidelines and national standards, but also a multidisciplinary discussion between breast cancer specialists for what is right for the individual patient's unique circumstances.	2014

24987138	Subcapsular transplantation of tissue in the kidney.	Multiple sites can be used for the engraftment of primary human cells and tissues into murine hosts. For example, leukemias are usually best engrafted intravenously, but they can also be engrafted directly into the bone marrow cavity. Some solid tumors such as colon tumors grow successfully following subcutaneous engraftment, sometimes requiring provision of a Matrigel artificial basement membrane. In certain cases (e.g., human bladder cancer and ductal breast carcinoma), the use of the autochthonous site (bladder and mammary duct, respectively) is often most efficient, whereas the tumors can grow poorly when transplanted subcutaneously or heterochthonously. Here, we present a protocol for the surgical implantation of tissues under the kidney capsule. The kidney is especially suited for the transplantation of normal as well as malignant cells and tissues. It is very accessible, and transplanted tissues are well contained under the renal capsule in a highly vascularized site. Furthermore, the retroperitoneal location of the kidney, together with its separation from other organs, is advantageous both for imaging and biopsy.	2014
24983126	Radiosynthesis and biological evaluation of 68Ga-labeled colchicine conjugates.	Colchicine, a plant-derived alkaloid, is a known substrate for P-glycoprotein (Pgp), which confers multidrug resistance (MDR) to cancer cells and tumors, through enhanced efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs. Hence, radiolabeled colchicine can be a suitable probe for imaging of activity of Pgp transport in vivo and early diagnosis of MDR.	In the present study, colchicine was hydrolyzed to desacetylcolchiceine for conjugation with p-SCN-Bn-DOTA and p-SCN-Bn-NOTA. The resulting conjugates, DOTA-desacetylcolchiceine and NOTA-desacetylcolchiceine, were radiolabeled with 68Ga. The radiotracers 68Ga-DOTA-desacetylcolchiceine (68Ga-1) and 68Ga-NOTA-desacetylcolchiceine (68Ga-2) were evaluated in vitro (MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines) and in vivo (biodistribution studies, Swiss mice bearing fibrosarcoma tumors).	The radiotracers prepared in >97% radiochemical yield showed good in vitro binding and significant inhibition with 100-fold cold colchicine (p<0.05). In vivo the tumor uptake reached maximum at 120 minutes postinjection (68Ga-1: 2.35%±0.39% injected dose per gram [ID/g]; 68Ga-2: 1.5%±0.31% ID/g). Of the two radiotracers 68Ga-2 cleared faster from blood (p<0.05) with lower uptake in nontargeted organs as compared with 68Ga-1.	The radiotracer 68Ga-2 has shown improved pharmacokinetic features over 68Ga-1 and the previously reported 99mTc(CO)3-colchicine radiotracer. The preliminary studies with 68Ga-2 indicate its potential for in vivo targeting of tumor. However, the efficacy of the radiotracer for imaging of multidrug-resistant states will be ascertained in future.	2014
24975374	Isocentric integration of intensity-modulated radiotherapy with electron fields improves field junction dose uniformity in postmastectomy radiotherapy.	In postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT), the dose coverage of the planning target volume (PTV) with additional margins, including the chest wall, supraclavicular, interpectoral, internal mammary and axillar level I-III lymph nodes, is often compromised. Electron fields may improve the medial dose coverage while maintaining organ at risk (OAR) doses at an acceptable level, but at the cost of hot and cold spots at the electron and photon field junction. To improve PMRT dose coverage and uniformity, an isocentric technique combining tangential intensity-modulated (IM)RT fields with one medial electron field was implemented.	For 10 postmastectomy patients isocentric IMRT with electron plans were created and compared with a standard electron/photon mix and a standard tangent technique. PTV dose uniformity was evaluated based on the tolerance range (TR), i.e. the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean dose, a dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the 90% isodose coverage and the hot spot volumes. OAR and contralateral breast doses were also recorded.	IMRT with electrons significantly improved the PTV dose homogeneity and conformity based on the TR and DSC values when compared with the standard electron/photon and tangent technique (p < 0.02). The 90% isodose coverage improved to 86% compared with 82% and 80% for the standard techniques (p < 0.02). Compared with the standard electron/photon mix, IMRT smoothed the dose gradient in the electron and photon field junction and the volumes receiving a dose of 110% or more were reduced by a third. For all three strategies, the OAR and contralateral breast doses were within clinically tolerable limits.	Based on these results two-field IMRT combined with an electron field is a suitable strategy for PMRT.	2014
24928944	Molecular pathways: PI3K pathway phosphatases as biomarkers for cancer prognosis and therapy.	Cancer research has seen tremendous changes over the past decade. Fast progress in sequencing technology has afforded us with landmark genetic alterations, which had immediate impact on clinical science and practice by pointing to new kinase targets, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), the EGF receptor, or BRAF. The PI3K pathway for growth control has emerged as a prime example for both oncogene activation and tumor suppressor loss in cancer. Here, we discuss how therapy using PI3K pathway inhibitors could benefit from information on specific phosphatases, which naturally antagonize the kinase targets. This PI3K pathway is found mutated in most cancer types, including prostate, breast, colon, and brain tumors. The tumor-suppressing phosphatases operate at two levels. Lipid-level phosphatases, such as PTEN and INPP4B, revert PI3K activity to keep the lipid second messengers inactive. At the protein level, PHLPP1/2 protein phosphatases inactivate AKT kinase, thus antagonizing mTOR complex 2 activity. However, in contrast with their kinase counterparts the phosphatases are unlikely drug targets. They would need to be stimulated by therapy and are commonly deleted and mutated in cancer. Yet, because they occupy critical nodes in preventing cancer initiation and progression, the information on their status has tremendous potential in outcome prediction, and in matching the available kinase inhibitor repertoire with the right patients.

24909377	Cancer mortality and other causes of death in users of geothermal hot water.	Residents of geothermal areas have increased incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast, prostate, and kidney cancers. The aim was to study whether this is also reflected in cancer mortality among the population using geothermal hot water for space heating, washing, and showering.	The follow-up was from 1981 to 2009. Personal identifier of those 5-64 years of age was used in record linkage with nationwide death registry. Thus, vital and emigration status was ascertained. The exposed population was defined as inhabitants of communities with district heating generated from geothermal wells since 1972. Reference populations were inhabitants of other areas with different degrees of volcanic/geothermal activity. Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were adjusted for age, gender, education, housing, reproductive factors and smoking habits.	Among those using geothermal water, the HR for all causes of death was 0.98 (95% CI 0.91-1.05) as compared with cold reference area. The HR for breast cancer was 1.53 (1.04-2.24), prostate cancer 1.74 (1.21-2.52), kidney cancer 1.78 (1.03-3.07), and for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma 2.01 (1.05-3.38). HR for influenza was 3.36 (1.32-8.58) and for suicide 1.49 (1.03-2.17).	The significant excess mortality risk of breast and prostate cancers, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma confirmed the results of similarly designed studies in Iceland on cancer incidence among populations from high-temperature geothermal areas and users of geothermal hot water. The risk is not confined to cancers with good prognosis, but also concerns fatal cancers. Further studies are needed on the chemical and physical content of the water and the environment emissions in geothermal areas.	2015
24895461	Influence of biospecimen variables on proteomic biomarkers in breast cancer.	PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is being actively pursued as a therapeutic target for breast cancer. We sought to determine if tumor heterogeneity and biospecimen variables affect the evaluation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway markers.	Intraoperative image-guided core-needle biopsies (CNB), and central and peripheral surgical tumor specimens were prospectively collected in 53 patients with invasive breast cancer. Specimens were assessed with reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).	There was a moderate or strong correlation between the expression of 149 (97%) of the 154 different RPPA markers in the center and periphery. Correlation was higher for smaller tumors, in patients who did not undergo neoadjuvant therapy, and with shorter cold ischemia time. Of 154 markers, 132 (86%) were not statistically different between the center and periphery, and 97 (63%) were not different between the CNB and the surgical specimen (average of the central and peripheral specimen). pAkt S473 and PTEN had a significant correlation between central and peripheral specimens, and between CNB and surgical specimen. However, pAkt S473, pS6 S235/236, and pS6 240/244 levels were significantly higher in CNB than the central specimens both by RPPA and by IHC.	Most individual proteomic biomarkers studied do not have significant intratumoral heterogeneity. However, protein and phosphoprotein levels are affected by biospecimen type and other preanalytic variables. PI3K pathway activation is greater in CNB compared with postexcision surgical samples suggesting a potential loss of phosphorylation during surgical manipulation, or with cold ischemia of surgical specimens.	2014
24887861	Giant osteosarcoma of chest wall requiring resection and pneumonectomy.	We present the case of a 13-year-old girl who had a large swelling in her left breast with a history of weight loss, low-grade fever, and cold sweats. Computed tomography showed a large mass encroaching on the mediastinum and heart, with erosion of the adjacent ribs. Resection of the mass along with a pneumonectomy were performed. Postoperative tests showed no sign of metastases.	2014
24845231	Targeting the disordered C terminus of PTP1B with an allosteric inhibitor.	PTP1B, a validated therapeutic target for diabetes and obesity, has a critical positive role in HER2 signaling in breast tumorigenesis. Efforts to develop therapeutic inhibitors of PTP1B have been frustrated by the chemical properties of the active site. We define a new mechanism of allosteric inhibition that targets the C-terminal, noncatalytic segment of PTP1B. We present what is to our knowledge the first ensemble structure of PTP1B containing this intrinsically disordered segment, within which we identified a binding site for the small-molecule inhibitor MSI-1436. We demonstrate binding to a second site close to the catalytic domain, with cooperative effects between the two sites locking PTP1B in an inactive state. MSI-1436 antagonized HER2 signaling, inhibited tumorigenesis in xenografts and abrogated metastasis in the NDL2 mouse model of breast cancer, validating inhibition of PTP1B as a therapeutic strategy in breast cancer. This new approach to inhibition of PTP1B emphasizes the potential of disordered segments of proteins as specific binding sites for therapeutic small molecules.	2014
24743201	[Effectiveness of skin icing for reducing pain associated with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist injection].	We evaluated the effect of using the cooling method on pain at the site of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone(LH-RH) agonist injection in 181 prostate cancer or premenopausal breast cancer patients by using a numerical rating scale(NRS)and a questionnaire survey with open-ended questions. According to the NRS, 38.1% of the patients experienced a reduction in pain, 37.5% experienced no change, and 24.4% experienced an increase in pain. Therefore, use of the cooling method did not have a statistically significant effect in terms of pain reduction(p=0.123). However, on analyzing pain reduction according to the answers in the questionnaire survey, 53.2% of the patients experienced a reduction in pain, 38.5% experienced no change, and 8.3% experienced an increase in pain. These findings were different from those obtained on using the NRS. In addition, irrespective of using the cooling method, needle thickness and patient obesity strongly influenced the pain experienced. The skin icing method was effective in reducing pain at the site of LH-RH agonist injection. This method is simple, inexpensive, and safe, and is hence recommended.	2014
24741199	Docetaxel-induced palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome and long-lasting multiple nail changes.	Palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome (PPES) and nail changes are common presentations of cutaneous toxicity of docetaxel chemotherapy, which deteriorate the quality of life of patients. Herein, we describe a female patient who developed PPES and multiple nail changes due to docetaxel treatment for infiltrative ductal carcinoma. Cold application and elevation of extremities during docetaxel infusion, potent topical steroids and oral pyridoxine increased the tolerance to chemotherapy and provided regression of painful cutaneous lesions without cessation of the treatment.
24719451	Ischemia in tumors induces early and sustained phosphorylation changes in stress kinase pathways but does not affect global protein levels.	Protein abundance and phosphorylation convey important information about pathway activity and molecular pathophysiology in diseases including cancer, providing biological insight, informing drug and diagnostic development, and guiding therapeutic intervention. Analyzed tissues are usually collected without tight regulation or documentation of ischemic time. To evaluate the impact of ischemia, we collected human ovarian tumor and breast cancer xenograft tissue without vascular interruption and performed quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics after defined ischemic intervals. Although the global expressed proteome and most of the >25,000 quantified phosphosites were unchanged after 60 min, rapid phosphorylation changes were observed in up to 24% of the phosphoproteome, representing activation of critical cancer pathways related to stress response, transcriptional regulation, and cell death. Both pan-tumor and tissue-specific changes were observed. The demonstrated impact of pre-analytical tissue ischemia on tumor biology mandates caution in interpreting stress-pathway activation in such samples and motivates reexamination of collection protocols for phosphoprotein analysis.	2014
24694649	Novel circulating microRNA signature as a potential non-invasive multi-marker test in ER-positive early-stage breast cancer: a case control study.	There are currently no highly sensitive and specific minimally invasive biomarkers for detection of early-stage breast cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are present in the circulation and may be unique biomarkers for early diagnosis of human cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the differential expression of miRNAs in the serum of breast cancer patients and healthy controls.	Global miRNA analysis was performed on serum from 48 patients with ER-positive early-stage breast cancer obtained at diagnosis (24 lymph node-positive and 24 lymph node-negative) and 24 age-matched healthy controls using LNA-based quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). A signature of miRNAs was subsequently validated in an independent set of 111 serum samples from 60 patients with early-stage breast cancer and 51 healthy controls and further tested for reproducibility in 3 independent data sets from the GEO Database.	A multivariable signature consisting of 9 miRNAs (miR-15a, miR-18a, miR-107, miR-133a, miR-139-5p, miR-143, miR-145, miR-365, miR-425) was identified that provided considerable discrimination between breast cancer patients and healthy controls. Further, the ability of the 9 miRNA signature to stratify samples from breast cancer patients and healthy controls was confirmed in the validation set (p = 0.012) with a corresponding AUC = 0.665 in the ROC-curve analysis. No association between miRNA expression and tumor grade, tumor size, menopausal- or lymph node status was observed. The signature was also successfully validated in a previously published independent data set of circulating miRNAs in early-stage breast cancer (p = 0.024).	We present herein a 9 miRNA signature capable of discriminating between ER-positive breast cancer and healthy controls. Using a specific algorithm based on the 9 miRNA signature, the risk for future individuals can be predicted. Since microRNAs are highly stable in blood components, this signature might be useful in the development of a blood-based multi-marker test to improve early detection of breast cancer. Such a test could potentially be used as a screening tool to identify individuals who would benefit from further diagnostic assessment.	2014
24662921	Mislocalization of the cell polarity protein scribble promotes mammary tumorigenesis and is associated with basal breast cancer.	Scribble (SCRIB) localizes to cell-cell junctions and regulates establishment of epithelial cell polarity. Loss of expression of SCRIB functions as a tumor suppressor in Drosophila and mammals; conversely, overexpression of SCRIB promotes epithelial differentiation in mammals. Here, we report that SCRIB is frequently amplified, mRNA overexpressed, and protein is mislocalized from cell-cell junctions in human breast cancers. High levels of SCRIB mRNA are associated with poor clinical prognosis, identifying an unexpected role for SCRIB in breast cancer. We find that transgenic mice expressing a SCRIB mutant [Pro 305 to Leu (P305L)] that fails to localize to cell-cell junctions, under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat promoter, develop multifocal hyperplasia that progresses to highly pleomorphic and poorly differentiated tumors with basal characteristics. SCRIB interacts with phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and the expression of P305L, but not wild-type SCRIB, promotes an increase in PTEN levels in the cytosol. Overexpression of P305L, but not wild-type SCRIB, activates the Akt/mTOR/S6K signaling pathway. Human breast tumors overexpressing SCRIB have high levels of S6K but do not harbor mutations in PTEN or PIK3CA, identifying SCRIB amplification as a mechanism of activating PI3K signaling in tumors without mutations in PIK3CA or PTEN. Thus, we demonstrate that high levels of mislocalized SCRIB functions as a neomorph to promote mammary tumorigenesis by affecting subcellular localization of PTEN and activating an Akt/mTOR/S6kinase signaling pathway.	2014
24606433	Spatial analysis of colorectal cancer cases in Kuala Lumpur.	In Malaysia, data from the Malaysian Health Ministry showed colorectal cancer (CRC) to be the second most common type of cancer in 2007-2009, after breast cancer. The same was apparent after looking at males and females cases separately. In the present study, the Geographic Information System (GIS) was employed to describe the distribution of CRC cases in Kuala Lumpur (KL), Malaysia, according to socio-demographic factors (age, gender, ethnicity and district).	This retrospective review concerned data for patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer in the years 1995 to 2011 collected from the Wilayah Persekutuan Health Office, taken from the cancer notification form (NCR-2), and patient medical records from the Surgical Department, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). A total of 146 cases were analyzed. All the data collected were analysed using ArcGIS version 10.0 and SPSS version 19.0.	Patients aged 60 to 69 years accounted for the highest proportion of cases (34.2%) and males slightly predominated 76 (52.1%), Chinese had the highest number of registered cases at 108 (74.0%) and staging revealed most cases in the 3rd and 4th stages. Kernel density analysis showed more cases are concentrated up in the northern area of Petaling and Kuala Lumpur subdistricts. Spatial global pattern analysis by average nearest neighbour resulted in nearest neighbour ratio of 0.75, with Z-score of -5.59, p value of <0.01 and the z-score of -5.59. Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I) showed clustering significant with p<0.01, Z score 3.14 and Moran's Index of 0.007. When mapping clusters with hotspot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi), hot and cold spots were identified. Hot spot areas fell on the northeast side of KL.	This study demonstrated significant spatial patterns of cancer incidence in KL. Knowledge about these spatial patterns can provide useful information to policymakers in the planning of screening of CRC in the targeted population and improvement of healthcare facilities to provide better treatment for CRC patients.	2014
24602449	Global gene expression changes induced by prolonged cold ischemic stress and preservation method of breast cancer tissue.	Tissue handling can alter global gene expression potentially affecting the analytical performance of genomic signatures, but such effects have not been systematically evaluated.	Tissue samples from 11 previously untreated breast tumors were minced and aliquots were either snap frozen or placed in RNAlater immediately or after 20, 40, 60, 120 or 180 min at room temperature. RNA was profiled on Affymetrix HG-U133A arrays. We used probe-set-wise hierarchical models to evaluate the effect of preservation method on transcript expression and linear mixed effects models to assess the effect of cold ischemic delay on the expression of individual probe sets. Gene set enrichment analysis identified pathways overrepresented in the affected transcripts. We combined the levels of 41 most sensitive transcripts to develop an index of ischemic stress.	Concordance in global gene expression between the baseline and 40 min delay was higher for samples preserved in RNAlater (average concordance correlation coefficient CCC = 0.92 compared to 0.88 for snap frozen). Overall, 481 transcripts (3%) were significantly affected by the preservation method, most of them involved in processes important in cancer. Prolonged cold ischemic delay of up to 3 h induced marginal global gene expression changes (average CCC = 0.90 between baseline and 3 h delay). However 41 transcripts were significantly affected by cold ischemic delay. Among the induced transcripts were stress response genes, apoptotic response genes; among the downregulated were genes involved in metabolism, protein processing and cell cycle regulation. An index combining the expression levels of these genes was proportional to the cold ischemic delay.	Prolonged cold ischemia induces significant transcriptional changes in a small subset of transcripts in the tissue. Furthermore, the expression level of about 3% of the transcripts is affected by the preservation method. These sensitive transcripts should not be included in genomic signatures for more reliable analytical performance.	2014
24599592	G-protein-coupled receptor GPR161 is overexpressed in breast cancer and is a promoter of cell proliferation and invasion.	Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 20% of breast cancer in women and lacks an effective targeted therapy. Therefore, finding common vulnerabilities in these tumors represents an opportunity for more effective treatment. Despite the growing appreciation of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signaling in cancer pathogenesis, very little is known about the role GPCRs play in TNBC. Using genomic information of human breast cancer, we have discovered that the orphan GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor 161 (GPR161) is overexpressed specifically in TNBC and correlates with poor prognosis. Knockdown of GPR161 impairs proliferation of human basal breast cancer cell lines. Overexpression of GPR161 in human mammary epithelial cells increases cell proliferation, migration, intracellular accumulation of E-cadherin, and formation of multiacinar structures in 3D culture. GPR161 forms a signaling complex with the scaffold proteins β-arrestin 2 and Ile Gln motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 1, a regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 and E-cadherin. Consistently, GPR161 amplified breast tumors and cells overexpressing GPR161 activate mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and decrease Ile Gln motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 1 phosphorylation. Thus, we identify the orphan GPCR, GPR161, as an important regulator and a potential drug target for TNBC.	2014
24591689	In vivo delivery of lenti-Cre or adeno-Cre into mice using intranasal instillation.	Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths among both men and women, with a lower rate of survival than both breast and prostate cancer. Development of the Cre/lox system and improved mouse models have allowed researchers to gain a better understanding of human disease, including lung cancer. Through the viral delivery of Cre, gene function in adult mice can be precisely studied at a specific developmental stage or in a specific cell/tissue type of choice. This protocol describes how to produce adenovirus-Cre precipitate. Using this adeno-Cre (or lentivirus-Cre), Cre can be expressed in mouse lungs. The virus is delivered by intranasal instillation.	2014
24535259	A tissue quality index: an intrinsic control for measurement of effects of preanalytical variables on FFPE tissue.	While efforts are made to improve tissue quality and control preanalytical variables, pathologists are often confronted with the challenge of molecular analysis of patient samples of unknown quality. Here we describe a first attempt to construct a tissue quality index (TQI) or an intrinsic control that would allow a global assessment of protein status based on quantitative measurement of a small number of selected, informative epitopes. Quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF) of a number of proteins was performed on a series of 93 breast cancer cases where levels of expression were assessed as a function of delayed time to formalin fixation. A TQI was constructed based on the combination of proteins that most accurately reflect increased and decreased levels of expression in proportion to delay time. The TQI, defined by combinations of measurements of cytokeratin, ERK1/2 and pHSP-27 and their relationship to cold ischemic time were validated on a second build of the training series and on two independent breast tissue cohorts with recorded time to formalin fixation. We show an association of negative TQI values (an indicator for loss of tissue quality) with increasing cold ischemic time on both validation cohorts and an association with loss of ER expression levels on all three breast cohorts. Using expression levels of three epitopes, we can begin to assess the likelihood of delayed time to fixation or decreased tissue quality. This TQI represents a proof of concept for the use of epitope expression to provide a mechanism for monitoring tissue quality.	2014
24468979	White, brown and pink adipocytes: the extraordinary plasticity of the adipose organ.	In mammals, adipocytes are lipid-laden cells making up the parenchyma of the multi-depot adipose organ. White adipocytes store lipids for release as free fatty acids during fasting periods; brown adipocytes burn glucose and lipids to maintain thermal homeostasis. A third type of adipocyte, the pink adipocyte, has recently been characterised in mouse subcutaneous fat depots during pregnancy and lactation. Pink adipocytes are mammary gland alveolar epithelial cells whose role is to produce and secrete milk. Emerging evidence suggests that they derive from the transdifferentiation of subcutaneous white adipocytes. The functional response of the adipose organ to a range of metabolic and environmental challenges highlights its extraordinary plasticity. Cold exposure induces an increase in the 'brown' component of the organ to meet the increased thermal demand; in states of positive energy balance, the 'white' component expands to store excess nutrients; finally, the 'pink' component develops in subcutaneous depots during pregnancy to ensure litter feeding. At the cell level, plasticity is provided not only by stem cell proliferation and differentiation but also, distinctively, by direct transdifferentiation of fully differentiated adipocytes by the stimuli that induce genetic expression reprogramming and through it a change in phenotype and, consequently function. A greater understanding of adipocyte transdifferentiation mechanisms would have the potential to shed light on their biology as well as inspire novel therapeutic strategies against metabolic syndrome (browning) and breast cancer (pinking).	2014
24443788	High prevalence of Y-box protein-1/p18 fragment in plasma of patients with malignancies of different origin.	Expression of the cold shock protein Y-box protein 1 (YB-1) is associated with deleterious outcome in various malignant diseases. Our group recently showed that the detection of an 18 kDa YB-1 fragment (YB-1/p18) in human plasma identifies patients with malignant diseases. We now tested the prevalence, clinical, and diagnostic value of YB-1/p18 detection in common tumors.	A newly established monoclonal YB-1 antibody was used to detect YB-1/p18 by immunoblotting in plasma samples from 151 unselected tumor patients, alongside established tumor markers and various diagnostic measures, during evaluation for a cancerous disease and in follow-up studies after therapeutic interventions.	Circulating YB-1/p18 was detected in 78% of patients having a tumor disease. YB-1/p18 positivity was highly prevalent in all examined malignancies, including lung cancer (32/37; 87%), breast cancer (7/10; 70%), cancer of unknown primary (CUP; 5/5, 100%) or hematological malignancies (42/62; 68%). Positivity for YB-1/p18 was independent of other routine laboratory parameters, tumor stage, or histology. In comparison to 13 established tumor markers (cancer antigens 15-3, 19-9, 72-4, and 125; carcinoembryonic antigen; cytokeratin fragments 21-1; neuron-specific enolase; alpha-fetoprotein; beta-2-microglobulin; squamous cell carcinoma antigen; thymidine kinase; tissue polypeptide antigen; pro-gastrin-releasing peptide), YB-1/p18 detection within serum samples was the most sensitive general parameter identifying malignant disorders. YB-1/p18 concentrations altered during therapeutic interventions, but did not predict prognosis.	Plasma YB-1/p18 detection has a high specific prevalence in malignancies, thereby providing a novel tool for cancer screening independent of the tumor origin.	2014
24354380	Case 201: glomus tumor of the breast.	History A 55-year-old woman presented to our breast clinic with 1-year history of lancinating pain in the right breast that was exacerbated by blunt pressure and cold temperature. She denied any family history of breast cancer or any personal history of trauma, infection, or surgery of the breast. On clinical examination, exquisite pain was generated by simple light pressure over the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. Mammography and ultrasounography (US) with Doppler analysis of the right breast were painful but were performed with the least pressure possible.	2014
24343288	Effect of catechol-o-methyltransferase-gene (COMT) variants on experimental and acute postoperative pain in 1,000 women undergoing surgery for breast cancer.	Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) metabolizes catecholamines in different tissues. Polymorphisms in COMT gene can attenuate COMT activity and increase sensitivity to pain. Human studies exploring the effect of COMT polymorphisms on pain sensitivity have mostly included small, heterogeneous samples and have ignored several important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). This study examines the effect of COMT polymorphisms on experimental and postoperative pain phenotypes in a large ethnically homogeneous female patient cohort.	Intensity of cold (+2-4°C) and heat (+48°C) pain and tolerance to cold pain were assessed in 1,000 patients scheduled for breast cancer surgery. Acute postoperative pain and oxycodone requirements were recorded. Twenty-two COMT SNPs were genotyped and their association with six pain phenotypes analyzed with linear regression.	There was no association between any of the tested pain phenotypes and SNP rs4680. The strongest association signals were seen between rs165774 and heat pain intensity as well as rs887200 and cold pain intensity. In both cases, minor allele carriers reported less pain. Neither of these results remained significant after strict multiple testing corrections. When analyzed further, the effect of rs887200 was, however, shown to be significant and consistent throughout the cold pressure test. No evidence of association between the SNPs and postoperative oxycodone consumption was found.	SNPs rs887200 and rs165774 located in the untranslated regions of the gene had the strongest effects on pain sensitivity. Their effect on pain is described here for the first time. These results should be confirmed in further studies and the potential functional mechanisms of the variants studied.	2013
24343286	Pain in 1,000 women treated for breast cancer: a prospective study of pain sensitivity and postoperative pain.	This article describes the methods and results of the early part (experimental pain tests and postoperative analgesia) of a study that assesses genetic and other factors related to acute pain and persistent pain after treatment of breast cancer in a prospective cohort of 1,000 women.	One thousand consenting patients were recruited to the study. Before surgery (breast resection or mastectomy with axillary surgery), the patients filled in questionnaires about health, life style, depression (Beck Depression Inventory), and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). They were also exposed to experimental tests measuring heat (43° and 48°C, 5 s) and cold (2-4°C) pain intensity and tolerance. Anesthesia was standardized with propofol and remifentanil, and postoperative analgesia was optimized with i.v. oxycodone.	The patients showed significant interindividual variation in heat and cold pain sensitivity and cold pain tolerance. There was a strong correlation between the experimental pain measures across the tests. Presence of chronic pain, the number of previous operations, and particularly state anxiety were related to increased pain sensitivity. Previous smoking correlated with decreased heat pain sensitivity. These factors explained 4-5% of the total variance in pain sensitivity in these tests. Oxycodone consumption during 20 h was significantly higher in patients who had axillary clearance. Oxycodone consumption had only a weak correlation with the experimental pain measures.	Contact heat and cold pressure tests identify variability in pain sensitivity which is modified by factors such as anxiety, chronic pain, previous surgery, and smoking.

24337606	Tumor imaging in patients with advanced tumors using a new (99m) Tc-radiolabeled vitamin B12 derivative.	Targeting cancer cells with vitamin B12 (cobalamin) is hampered by unwanted physiologic tissue uptake mediated by transcobalamin. Adhering to good manufacturing practice, we have developed a new (99m)Tc-cobalamin derivative ((99m)Tc(CO)3-[(4-amido-butyl)-pyridin-2-yl-methyl-amino-acetato] cobalamin, (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin). The derivative shows no binding to transcobalamin but is recognized by haptocorrin, a protein present in the circulation and notably expressed in many tumor cells. In this prospective study, we investigated cancer-specific uptake of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin in 10 patients with various metastatic tumors.	Ten patients with biopsy-proven metastatic cancer were included. Dynamic imaging was started immediately after injection of 300-500 MBq of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin, and whole-body scintigrams were obtained at 10, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min and after 24 h. The relative tumor activity using SPECT/CT over the tumor region after 4 h was measured in comparison to disease-free lung parenchyma. Patients 3-10 received between 20 and 1,000 μg of cobalamin intravenously before injection of (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin. The study population comprised 4 patients with adenocarcinomas of the lung, 3 with squamous cell carcinomas of the hypopharyngeal region, 1 with prostate adenocarcinoma, 1 with breast, and 1 with colon adenocarcinoma.	The median age of the study group was 61 ± 11 y. Six of 10 patients showed positive tumor uptake on (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin whole-body scintigraphy. The scan was positive in 1 patient with colon adenocarcinoma, in 3 of 4 lung adenocarcinomas, in 1 of 3 hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas, and in 1 breast adenocarcinoma. Renal uptake was between 1% and 3% for the left kidney. Predosing with cobalamin increased the tumor uptake and improved blood-pool clearance. The best image quality was achieved with a predose of 20-100 ug of cold cobalamin. The mean patient dose was 2.7 ± 0.9 mSv/patient.	To our knowledge, we report for the first time on (99m)Tc-PAMA-cobalamin imaging in patients with metastatic cancer disease and show that tumor targeting is feasible.	2014
24327332	Osteolysis and pain due to experimental bone metastases are improved by treatment with rapamycin.	In advanced breast cancer, bone metastases occur in 70 % of patients. Managing the devastating pain associated with the disease is difficult. Rapamycin is an immunomodulatory drug that targets the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. Rapamycin has been shown to decrease osteolysis associated with metastatic breast cancer in pre-clinical models and to reduce pain in inflammatory and neuropathic models. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of rapamycin in reducing pain associated with experimental osteolytic metastases. Bone cancer was induced by intra-tibial injections of murine mammary carcinoma cells (4T1) in immunocompetent BALB/c mice and treated intraperitoneally for up to 5 weeks with vehicle, rapamycin or pamidronate (a bisphosphonate currently used to reduce bone loss in bone cancer patients). The control group received intra-tibial injection with saline (sham) and was treated with vehicle intraperitoneally. Cancer-induced osteolysis was observed histologically and radiographically 2-3 weeks following cancer inoculation and gradually increased with time. Measures of evoked nociceptive behaviors including sensitivity to mechanical, thermal, and cold stimuli and spontaneous nociceptive behaviors (limping, guarding) were evaluated. Significant hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli developed in cancer-bearing mice compared to sham 3 weeks following inoculation. Rapamycin decreased or delayed the development of cancer-induced mechanical, heat, and cold hypersensitivity, while pamidronate reduced heat and cold hypersensitivity. Both rapamycin and pamidronate had a partial protective effect on the spontaneous nociceptive behaviors, limping and guarding. Our data suggest that rapamycin may have efficacy in the management of pain associated with metastatic breast cancer.	2014
24260353	Links between the oncoprotein YB-1 and small non-coding RNAs in breast cancer.	The nucleic acid-binding protein YB-1, a member of the cold-shock domain protein family, has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer and is associated with poor patient survival. YB-1 has sequence similarity to LIN28, another cold-shock protein family member, which has a role in the regulation of small noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs) including microRNAs (miRNAs). Therefore, to investigate whether there is an association between YB-1 and sncRNAs in breast cancer, we investigated whether sncRNAs were bound by YB-1 in two breast cancer cell lines (luminal A-like and basal cell-like), and whether the abundance of sncRNAs and mRNAs changed in response to experimental reduction of YB-1 expression.	RNA-immunoprecipitation with an anti-YB-1 antibody showed that several sncRNAs are bound by YB-1. Some of these were bound by YB-1 in both breast cancer cell lines; others were cell-line specific. The small RNAs bound by YB-1 were derived from various sncRNA families including miRNAs such as let-7 and miR-320, transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNA). Reducing YB-1 expression altered the abundance of a number of transcripts encoding miRNA biogenesis and processing proteins but did not alter the abundance of mature or precursor miRNAs.	YB-1 binds to specific miRNAs, snoRNAs and tRNA-derived fragments and appears to regulate the expression of miRNA biogenesis and processing machinery. We propose that some of the oncogenic effects of YB-1 in breast cancer may be mediated through its interactions with sncRNAs.	2013
24258260	Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR is an independent prognostic marker of metastasis in estrogen receptor-positive primary breast cancer.	Expression of HOX transcript antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR)--a long non-coding RNA--has been examined in a variety of human cancers, and overexpression of HOTAIR is correlated with poor survival among breast, colon, and liver cancer patients. In this retrospective study, we examine HOTAIR expression in 164 primary breast tumors, from patients who do not receive adjuvant treatment, in a design that is paired with respect to the traditional prognostic markers. We show that HOTAIR expression differs between patients with or without a metastatic endpoint, respectively. Survival analysis shows that high HOTAIR expression in primary tumors is significantly associated with worse prognosis independent of prognostic markers (P = 0.012, hazard ratio (HR) 1.747). This association is even stronger when looking only at estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumor samples (P = 0.0086, HR 1.985). In ER-negative tumor samples, we are not able to detect a prognostic value of HOTAIR expression, probably due to the limited sample size. These results are successfully validated in an independent dataset with similar associations (P = 0.018, HR 1.825). In conclusion, our findings suggest that HOTAIR expression may serve as an independent biomarker for the prediction of the risk of metastasis in ER-positive breast cancer patients.	2013
24217252	Receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase α regulates focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and ErbB2 oncoprotein-mediated mammary epithelial cell motility.	We investigated the role of protein-tyrosine phosphatase α (PTPα) in regulating signaling by the ErbB2 oncoprotein in mammary epithelial cells. Using this model, we demonstrated that activation of ErbB2 led to the transient inactivation of PTPα, suggesting that attenuation of PTPα activity may contribute to enhanced ErbB2 signaling. Furthermore, RNAi-induced suppression of PTPα led to increased cell migration in an ErbB2-dependent manner. The ability of ErbB2 to increase cell motility in the absence of PTPα was characterized by prolonged interaction of GRB7 with ErbB2 and increased association of ErbB2 with a β1-integrin-rich complex, which depended on GRB7-SH2 domain interactions. Finally, suppression of PTPα resulted in increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase on Tyr-407, which induced the recruitment of vinculin and the formation of a novel focal adhesion kinase complex in response to ErbB2 activation in mammary epithelial cells. Collectively, these results reveal a new role for PTPα in the regulation of motility of mammary epithelial cells in response to ErbB2 activation.	2013
24068959	System-wide analysis reveals a complex network of tumor-fibroblast interactions involved in tumorigenicity.	Many fibroblast-secreted proteins promote tumorigenicity, and several factors secreted by cancer cells have in turn been proposed to induce these proteins. It is not clear whether there are single dominant pathways underlying these interactions or whether they involve multiple pathways acting in parallel. Here, we identified 42 fibroblast-secreted factors induced by breast cancer cells using comparative genomic analysis. To determine what fraction was active in promoting tumorigenicity, we chose five representative fibroblast-secreted factors for in vivo analysis. We found that the majority (three out of five) played equally major roles in promoting tumorigenicity, and intriguingly, each one had distinct effects on the tumor microenvironment. Specifically, fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin promoted breast cancer cell survival, whereas the chemokine CCL7 stimulated tumor cell proliferation while CCL2 promoted innate immune cell infiltration and angiogenesis. The other two factors tested had minor (CCL8) or minimally (STC1) significant effects on the ability of fibroblasts to promote tumor growth. The importance of parallel interactions between fibroblasts and cancer cells was tested by simultaneously targeting fibroblast-secreted amphiregulin and the CCL7 receptor on cancer cells, and this was significantly more efficacious than blocking either pathway alone. We further explored the concept of parallel interactions by testing the extent to which induction of critical fibroblast-secreted proteins could be achieved by single, previously identified, factors produced by breast cancer cells. We found that although single factors could induce a subset of genes, even combinations of factors failed to induce the full repertoire of functionally important fibroblast-secreted proteins. Together, these results delineate a complex network of tumor-fibroblast interactions that act in parallel to promote tumorigenicity and suggest that effective anti-stromal therapeutic strategies will need to be multi-targeted.	2013
24048820	Taccalonolide binding to tubulin imparts microtubule stability and potent in vivo activity.	The taccalonolides are highly acetylated steroids that stabilize cellular microtubules and overcome multiple mechanisms of taxane resistance. Recently, two potent taccalonolides, AF and AJ, were identified that bind to tubulin directly and enhance microtubule polymerization. Extensive studies were conducted to characterize these new taccalonolides. AF and AJ caused aberrant mitotic spindles and bundling of interphase microtubules that differed from the effects of either paclitaxel or laulimalide. AJ also distinctly affected microtubule polymerization in that it enhanced the rate and extent of polymerization in the absence of any noticeable effect on microtubule nucleation. In addition, the resulting microtubules were found to be profoundly cold stable. These data, along with studies showing synergistic antiproliferative effects between AJ and either paclitaxel or laulimalide, suggest a distinct binding site. Direct binding studies demonstrated that AJ could not be displaced from microtubules by paclitaxel, laulimalide, or denaturing conditions, suggesting irreversible binding of AJ to microtubules. Mass spectrometry confirmed a covalent interaction of AJ with a peptide of β-tubulin containing the cyclostreptin-binding sites. Importantly, AJ imparts strong inter-protofilament stability in a manner different from other microtubule stabilizers that covalently bind to tubulin, consistent with the distinct effects of the taccalonolides as compared with other stabilizers. AF was found to be a potent and effective antitumor agent that caused tumor regression in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenograft model. The antitumor efficacy of some taccalonolides, which stabilize microtubules in a manner different from other microtubule stabilizers, provides the impetus to explore the therapeutic potential of this site.	2013
24040051	Cold atmospheric plasma for selectively ablating metastatic breast cancer cells.	Traditional breast cancer treatments such as surgery and radiotherapy contain many inherent limitations with regards to incomplete and nonselective tumor ablation. Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) is an ionized gas where the ion temperature is close to room temperature. It contains electrons, charged particles, radicals, various excited molecules, UV photons and transient electric fields. These various compositional elements have the potential to either enhance and promote cellular activity, or disrupt and destroy them. In particular, based on this unique composition, CAP could offer a minimally-invasive surgical approach allowing for specific cancer cell or tumor tissue removal without influencing healthy cells. Thus, the objective of this research is to investigate a novel CAP-based therapy for selectively bone metastatic breast cancer treatment. For this purpose, human metastatic breast cancer (BrCa) cells and bone marrow derived human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were separately treated with CAP, and behavioral changes were evaluated after 1, 3, and 5 days of culture. With different treatment times, different BrCa and MSC cell responses were observed. Our results showed that BrCa cells were more sensitive to these CAP treatments than MSCs under plasma dose conditions tested. It demonstrated that CAP can selectively ablate metastatic BrCa cells in vitro without damaging healthy MSCs at the metastatic bone site. In addition, our study showed that CAP treatment can significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of BrCa cells. The results suggest the great potential of CAP for breast cancer therapy.	2013
24034496	Characterization of synergistic anti-cancer effects of docosahexaenoic acid and curcumin on DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis in mice.	The major obstacles to the successful use of individual nutritional compounds as preventive or therapeutic agents are their efficacy and bioavailability. One approach to overcoming this problem is to use combinations of nutrients to induce synergistic effects. The objective of this research was to investigate the synergistic effects of two dietary components: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an omega-3 fatty acid present in cold-water fish, and curcumin (CCM), an herbal nutrient present in turmeric, in an in vivo model of DMBA-induced mammary tumorigenesis in mice.	We used the carcinogen DMBA to induce breast tumors in SENCAR mice on control, CCM, DHA, or DHA + CCM diets. Appearance and tumor progression were monitored daily. The tumors were harvested 15 days following their first appearance for morphological and immunohistological analysis. Western analysis was performed to determine expression of maspin and survivin in the tumor tissues. Characterization of tumor growth was analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Otherwise all other results are reported as mean ± SD and analyzed with one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post hoc procedure.	Analysis of gene microarray data indicates that combined treatment with DHA + CCM altered the profile of "PAM50" genes in the SK-BR-3 cell line from an ER⁻/Her-2⁺ to that resembling a "normal-like" phenotype. The in vivo studies demonstrated that DHA + CCM treatment reduced the incidence of breast tumors, delayed tumor initiation, and reduced progression of tumor growth. Dietary treatment had no effect on breast size development, but tumors from mice on a control diet (untreated) were less differentiated than tumors from mice fed CCM or DHA + CCM diets. The synergistic effects also led to increased expression of the pro-apoptotic protein, maspin, but reduced expression of the anti-apoptotic protein, survivin.	The SK-BR-3 cells and DMBA-induced tumors, both with an ER⁻ and Her-2⁺ phenotype, were affected by the synergistic interaction of DHA and CCM. This suggests that the specific breast cancer phenotype is an important factor for predicting efficacy of these nutraceuticals. The combination of DHA and CCM is potentially a dietary supplemental treatment for some breast cancers, likely dependent upon the molecular phenotype of the cancer.	2013
26207147	REDOX IMAGING OF THE p53-DEPENDENT MITOCHONDRIAL REDOX STATE IN COLON CANCER EX VIVO.	The mitochondrial redox state and its heterogeneity of colon cancer at tissue level have not been previously reported. Nor has how p53 regulates mitochondrial respiration been measured at (deep) tissue level, presumably due to the unavailability of the technology that has sufficient spatial resolution and tissue penetration depth. Our prior work demonstrated that the mitochondrial redox state and its intratumor heterogeneity is associated with cancer aggressiveness in human melanoma and breast cancer in mouse models, with the more metastatic tumors exhibiting localized regions of more oxidized redox state. Using the Chance redox scanner with an in-plane spatial resolution of 200 μm, we imaged the mitochondrial redox state of the wild-type p53 colon tumors (HCT116 p53 wt) and the p53-deleted colon tumors (HCT116 p53-/-) by collecting the fluorescence signals of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and oxidized flavoproteins [Fp, including flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)] from the mouse xenografts snap-frozen at low temperature. Our results show that: (1) both tumor lines have significant degree of intratumor heterogeneity of the redox state, typically exhibiting a distinct bi-modal distribution that either correlates with the spatial core-rim pattern or the "hot/cold" oxidation-reduction patches; (2) the p53-/- group is significantly more heterogeneous in the mitochondrial redox state and has a more oxidized tumor core compared to the p53 wt group when the tumor sizes of the two groups are matched; (3) the tumor size dependence of the redox indices (such as Fp and Fp redox ratio) is significant in the p53-/- group with the larger ones being more oxidized and more heterogeneous in their redox state, particularly more oxidized in the tumor central regions; (4) the H&E staining images of tumor sections grossly correlate with the redox images. The present work is the first to reveal at the submillimeter scale the intratumor heterogeneity pattern of the mitochondrial redox state in colon cancer and the first to indicate that at tissue level the mitochondrial redox state is p53 dependent. The findings should assist in our understanding on colon cancer pathology and developing new imaging biomarkers for clinical applications.	2013
23756360	One year of adjuvant tamoxifen compared with chemotherapy and tamoxifen in postmenopausal patients with stage II breast cancer.	We report the long-term results of a randomised trial comparing tamoxifen with tamoxifen plus cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and fluorouracil (CMF) in postmenopausal high-risk breast cancer patients. In addition, we analyse the prognostic and predictive value of centrally assessed subtypes.	Postmenopausal patients with breast cancer and positive nodes, deep invasion or size exceeding 5 cm were randomly assigned to 1 year of tamoxifen, or cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2, methotrexate 40 mg/m2 and fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1 every 4 weeks for nine cycles plus tamoxifen (CMFT). Tissue microarrays were constructed retrospectively and oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen (Ki67) status were assessed.	From October 1982 through March 1990 we randomised 1445 patients and 969 (67%) were eligible for the biomarker analysis. At 10-years 936 women had suffered a disease-free survival (DFS) event (tamoxifen, 495 events in 686 patients; CMFT, 441 events in 642 patients). The addition of CMF to tamoxifen significantly improved DFS (adjusted hazard ratio 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71-0.93; P = 0.003) but not overall survival (adjusted hazard ratio 0.95; 95% CI 0.85-1.08; P = 0.44). DFS was superior in Luminal A tumours (ER or PgR positive, HER2 negative and Ki67 ≤ 14%) when compared to Luminal B or non-luminal (ER and PgR negative) tumours. There was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity by subtype in the benefit from CMF (P(interaction) = 0.45).	CMF added to 1 year of tamoxifen reduces the risk of a DFS event. The benefit from CMF was not significantly different in Luminal A and B subtypes.	2013
23744040	Target inference from collections of genomic intervals.	Finding regions of the genome that are significantly recurrent in noisy data are a common but difficult problem in present day computational biology. Cores of recurrent events (CORE) is a computational approach to solving this problem that is based on a formalized notion by which "core" intervals explain the observed data, where the number of cores is the "depth" of the explanation. Given that formalization, we implement CORE as a combinatorial optimization procedure with depth chosen from considerations of statistical significance. An important feature of CORE is its ability to explain data with cores of widely varying lengths. We examine the performance of this system with synthetic data, and then provide two demonstrations of its utility with actual data. Applying CORE to a collection of DNA copy number profiles from single cells of a given tumor, we determine tumor population phylogeny and find the features that separate subpopulations. Applying CORE to comparative genomic hybridization data from a large set of tumor samples, we define regions of recurrent copy number aberration in breast cancer.	2013
23610368	A multi-layer inference approach to reconstruct condition-specific genes and their regulation.	An important topic in systems biology is the reverse engineering of regulatory mechanisms through reconstruction of context-dependent gene networks. A major challenge is to identify the genes and the regulations specific to a condition or phenotype, given that regulatory processes are highly connected such that a specific response is typically accompanied by numerous collateral effects. In this study, we design a multi-layer approach that is able to reconstruct condition-specific genes and their regulation through an integrative analysis of large-scale information of gene expression, protein interaction and transcriptional regulation (transcription factor-target gene relationships). We establish the accuracy of our methodology against synthetic datasets, as well as a yeast dataset. We then extend the framework to the application of higher eukaryotic systems, including human breast cancer and Arabidopsis thaliana cold acclimation. Our study identified TACSTD2 (TROP2) as a target gene for human breast cancer and discovered its regulation by transcription factors CREB, as well as NFkB. We also predict KIF2C is a target gene for ER-/HER2- breast cancer and is positively regulated by E2F1. The predictions were further confirmed through experimental studies.	The implementation and detailed protocol of the layer approach is available at http://www.egr.msu.edu/changroup/Protocols/Three-layer%20approach%20 to % 20reconstruct%20condition.html.	2013
23545416	Caspase functions in cell death and disease.	Caspases are a family of endoproteases that provide critical links in cell regulatory networks controlling inflammation and cell death. The activation of these enzymes is tightly controlled by their production as inactive zymogens that gain catalytic activity following signaling events promoting their aggregation into dimers or macromolecular complexes. Activation of apoptotic caspases results in inactivation or activation of substrates, and the generation of a cascade of signaling events permitting the controlled demolition of cellular components. Activation of inflammatory caspases results in the production of active proinflammatory cytokines and the promotion of innate immune responses to various internal and external insults. Dysregulation of caspases underlies human diseases including cancer and inflammatory disorders, and major efforts to design better therapies for these diseases seek to understand how these enzymes work and how they can be controlled.	2013
23460242	Nutrient composition, antioxidant properties, and anti-proliferative activity of Lignosus rhinocerus Cooke sclerotium.	Lignosus rhinocerus (tiger milk mushroom) is an important medicinal mushroom used in Southeast Asia and China, and its sclerotium can be developed into functional food/nutraceuticals. The nutrient composition, antioxidant properties, and anti-proliferative activity of wild type and a cultivated strain of L. rhinocerus sclerotia were investigated.	The sclerotial powder has high carbohydrate but low fat content. Interestingly, the cultivated strain contains higher amounts of protein and water-soluble substances than the wild type. Phenolic content of hot-water, cold-water, and methanol extracts of the sclerotial powders ranged from 19.32 to 29.42 mg gallic acid equivalents g⁻¹ extract, while the ferric reducing antioxidant power values ranged from 0.006 to 0.016 mmol min⁻¹ g⁻¹ extract. The DPPH• , ABTS•⁺ , and superoxide anion radical scavenging activities of the extracts ranged from 0.52 to 1.12, 0.05 to 0.20, and -0.98 to 11.23 mmol Trolox equivalents g⁻¹ extract, respectively. Both strains exhibited strong superoxide anion radical scavenging activity comparable to rutin. The cold-water extracts exhibited anti-proliferative activity against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cells, with IC₅₀ values of 206 µg mL⁻¹ and 90 µg mL⁻¹ for the wild type and cultivated strains, respectively.	The cultivated L. rhinocerus sclerotium has the potential to be developed into functional food/nutraceuticals.	2013
23457349	Brain tumor imaging: imaging brain metastasis using a brain-metastasizing breast adenocarcinoma.	Brain metastases from primary or secondary breast tumors are difficult to model in the mouse. When metastatic breast cancer cell lines are injected directly into the arterial circulation, only a small fraction of cells enter the brain to form metastatic foci. To study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of brain metastasis, we have transfected MB-231BR, a brain-homing derivative of a human breast adenocarcinoma line MDA-MB-231, with the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) variant Venus. MB-231BR selectively enters the brain after intracardiac injection into the arterial circulation, resulting in accumulation of fluorescent foci of cells in the brain that can be viewed by standard fluorescence imaging procedures. We describe how to perform the intracardiac injection and the parameters used to quantify brain metastasis in brain sections by standard one-photon fluorescence imaging. The disadvantage of this model is that the kinetics of growth over time cannot be determined in the same animal. In addition, the injection technique does not permit precise placement of tumor cells within the brain. This model is useful for determining the molecular determinants of brain tumor metastasis.	2013
23404367	Antiproliferative activity of Alpinia officinarum extract in the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7.	Alpinia officinarum (A. officinarum), a member of the ginger family, is used in traditional medicine to treat stomach ache, cold and swelling. Previous studies have demonstrated an anticancer effect of the A. officinarum extract and its major components in several cancer cell lines. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of this extract in breast cancer cells have not been fully elucidated to date. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the activity of a methanolic extract of A. officinarum, by examining its effects on the proliferation of the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. Notably, the extract inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation in a dose- and time‑dependent manner. To further elucidate the molecular mechanism, we examined whether the A. officinarum extract affected cell cycle progression in MCF-7 cells. The extract inhibited S-phase cell cycle progression by suppressing the expression levels of S-phase cell cycle regulatory proteins, including E2F1, cyclin‑dependent protein kinase 2 and cyclin A. Additionally, nuclear morphology and flow cytometry with Annexin V/propidium iodide dual staining demonstrated that apoptosis was induced. Western blot analysis using antibodies against apoptosis‑related proteins showed that cell death induced by the extract is mediated via caspase‑ and mitochondrial‑dependent pathways. These findings collectively indicate that the A. officinarum extract exerts an antiproliferative activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by inducing S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis.	2013
23372442	Unilateral breast uptake of tc-99m pertechnetate in a patient with cold nodule of the thyroid.	Common causes of unilateral breast uptake of Tc-99m pertechnetate are predominant breast-feeding on one side, mastitis, and breast cancer. Uptake of Tc-99m pertechnetate in the epithelial cells of the breast, like that of iodide, depends on the transmembrane sodium/iodide symporter (NIS), the expression of which is known to be greatly enhanced during lactation and in breast cancer. The authors present an interesting case of predominant left breast uptake of Tc-99m pertechnetate detected incidentally during thyroid scintigraphy, for the evaluation of a nodule in the left lobe of thyroid.	2012
23340529	Cooled sacroiliac radiofrequency denervation for the treatment of pain secondary to tumor infiltration: a case-based focused literature review.	The sacroiliac (SI) joint is a common cause of low back pain, for which radiofrequency (RF) denervation has been shown to provide long-term relief. However, controversy exists surrounding the innervation, which treatment paradigm to utilize, and how best to select patients who might benefit.	To describe a patient with terminal breast cancer and tumor infiltration of the sacroiliac joint who was treated with cooled RF of the sacral lateral branches as an end-of-life palliative measure. The objectives of this review are to provide insight into the innervation of the SI joint; address controversial issues surrounding the targeted nerves in a patient with transitional anatomy; outline risk-mitigation strategies; and highlight the need for individually tailored treatment plans.	Case-based focused literature review in a patient treated with cooled RF ablation of the L4-S3 primary dorsal rami and lateral branches.	Treatment was tailored to facilitate the rapid treatment of this terminal patient by performing the prognostic blocks and RF ablation at the same visit. Until her death 5 days post-procedure, the patient reported significant pain relief and began to ambulate and use the bathroom on her own, activities she could not do before treatment. In addition to functional improvement, she was also able to significantly reduce her opioid intake.	This is the first report of cooled SI joint RF ablation to treat cancer pain. Our patient's positive response to the procedure suggests the possibility that the lateral branches innervate not only the posterior ligaments, but also the bony articulation. The decision to proceed with RF ablation on the same day as a prognostic lateral branch block was based on our patient's terminal condition, and the fact that cooled RF does not require sensory stimulation to ensure proximity to the target nerves. Because of her transitional anatomy, we elected to target L4.	2013
23318393	Automated IMRT planning with regional optimization using planning scripts.	Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) has become a standard technique in radiation therapy for treating different types of cancers. Various class solutions have been developed for simple cases (e.g., localized prostate, whole breast) to generate IMRT plans efficiently. However, for more complex cases (e.g., head and neck, pelvic nodes), it can be time-consuming for a planner to generate optimized IMRT plans. To generate optimal plans in these more complex cases which generally have multiple target volumes and organs at risk, it is often required to have additional IMRT optimization structures such as dose limiting ring structures, adjust beam geometry, select inverse planning objectives and associated weights, and additional IMRT objectives to reduce cold and hot spots in the dose distribution. These parameters are generally manually adjusted with a repeated trial and error approach during the optimization process. To improve IMRT planning efficiency in these more complex cases, an iterative method that incorporates some of these adjustment processes automatically in a planning script is designed, implemented, and validated. In particular, regional optimization has been implemented in an iterative way to reduce various hot or cold spots during the optimization process that begins with defining and automatic segmentation of hot and cold spots, introducing new objectives and their relative weights into inverse planning, and turn this into an iterative process with termination criteria. The method has been applied to three clinical sites: prostate with pelvic nodes, head and neck, and anal canal cancers, and has shown to reduce IMRT planning time significantly for clinical applications with improved plan quality. The IMRT planning scripts have been used for more than 500 clinical cases.	2013
23293768	Major chromosomal breakpoint intervals in breast cancer co-localize with differentially methylated regions.	Solid tumors exhibit chromosomal rearrangements resulting in gain or loss of multiple chromosomal loci (copy number variation, or CNV), and translocations that occasionally result in the creation of novel chimeric genes. In the case of breast cancer, although most individual tumors each have unique CNV landscape, the breakpoints, as measured over large datasets, appear to be non-randomly distributed in the genome. Breakpoints show a significant regional concentration at genomic loci spanning perhaps several megabases. The proximal cause of these breakpoint concentrations is a subject of speculation, but is, as yet, largely unknown. To shed light on this issue, we have performed a bio-statistical analysis on our previously published data for a set of 119 breast tumors and normal controls (Wiedswang et al., 2003), where each sample has both high-resolution CNV and methylation data. The method examined the distribution of closeness of breakpoint regions with differentially methylated regions (DMR), coupled with additional genomic parameters, such as repeat elements and designated "fragile sites" in the reference genome. Through this analysis, we have identified a set of 93 regional loci called breakpoint enriched DMR (BEDMRs) characterized by altered DNA methylation in cancer compared to normal cells that are associated with frequent breakpoint concentrations within a distance of 1 Mb. BEDMR loci are further associated with local hypomethylation (66%), concentrations of the Alu SINE repeats within 3 Mb (35% of the cases), and tend to occur near a number of cancer related genes such as the protocadherins, AKT1, DUB3, GAB2. Furthermore, BEDMRs seem to deregulate members of the histone gene family and chromatin remodeling factors, e.g., JMJD1B, which might affect the chromatin structure and disrupt coordinate signaling and repair. From this analysis we propose that preference for chromosomal breakpoints is related to genome structure coupled with alterations in DNA methylation and hence, chromatin structure, associated with tumorigenesis.	2012
23290256	Persistent pain in postmastectomy patients: comparison of psychophysical, medical, surgical, and psychosocial characteristics between patients with and without pain.	Persistent postmastectomy pain (PPMP) is a major individual and public health problem. Increasingly, psychosocial factors such as anxiety and catastrophizing are being revealed as crucial contributors to individual differences in pain processing and outcomes. Furthermore, differences in patients' responses to standardized quantitative sensory testing (QST) may aid in the discernment of who is at risk for acute and chronic pain after surgery. However, characterization of the variables that differentiate those with PPMP from those whose acute postoperative pain resolves is currently incomplete. The purpose of this study was to investigate important surgical, treatment-related, demographic, psychophysical, and psychosocial factors associated with PPMP by comparing PPMP cases with PPMP-free controls. Pain was assessed using the breast cancer pain questionnaire to determine the presence and extent of PPMP. Psychosocial and demographic information were gathered via phone interview, and women underwent a QST session. Consistent with most prior research, surgical and disease-related variables did not differ significantly between cases and controls. Furthermore, treatment with radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy was also not more common among those with PPMP. In contrast, women with PPMP did show elevated levels of distress-related psychosocial factors such as anxiety, depression, catastrophizing, and somatization. Finally, QST in nonsurgical body areas revealed increased sensitivity to mechanical stimulation among PPMP cases, while thermal pain responses were not different between the groups. These findings suggest that an individual's psychophysical and psychosocial profile may be more strongly related to PPMP than their surgical treatment.	2013
23276917	Strong correlation between diet and development of colorectal cancer.	Multiple factors have been described among the causes of non-hereditary colorectal cancer. In Western countries, the most common risk factors include upper-middle socioeconomic status and dietary regimens rich in proteins and animal fats. High consumption of red meats, smoked foods, cold cuts, or canned foods is believed to contribute to carcinogenesis as they directly affect epithlial turnover and cause metabolism of biliary acids. Dietary fibers have protective effects in that they capture the fats and biliary acids, thereby inhibiting their activity. Tobacco smoking acts both locally and systemically on the colorectal mucosa through the production of carcinogenic agents. Finally, the action of alcohol, in association with nicotine addiction, also increases the risk of developing colorectal tumors. Knowledge of dietary and environmental factors is of paramount importance in implementing preventive strategies for colorectal cancer.	2013
26417238	Acceleration of pro-caspase-3 maturation and cell migration inhibition in human breast cancer cells by phytoconstituents of Rheum emodi rhizome extracts.	The aggressive nature of estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer subtype obligates for innovative targeted therapies. The present study aimed to investigate the phytoconstituents and specific anticancer activities of Rheum emodi rhizome, a known food source used locally to treat various ailments. Petroleum ether extracts (hot [PHR] and cold [PCR]) of R. emodi, exhibited significant free radical scavenging potentials through DPPH and reducing power assays, rendering them as good sources of antioxidants. The extracts, PHR and PCR had shown significant (P < 0.05) cancer-cell-specific cytotoxicity in the assayed cells (MDA-MB-231 [breast carcinoma] and WRL-68 [non-tumoral]) at 100 μg/ml, and 50 and 100 μg/ml concentrations respectively. Extracts also induced fervent apoptosis in ER-negative cells (MDA-MB-231) compared to ER-positive subtype (MCF-7), and found to involve CPP32/caspase-3 in its apoptosis induction mechanism. Moreover, extracts had an inevitable potential to inhibit the migration of metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) in vitro. Further, the active principles of extracts were identified through HPLC and GC-MS analysis to reveal major polyphenolics, 4,7-Dimethyl-(octahydro)indolo[4,3-fg]quinolin-10-one, 5-Oxo-isolongifolene, Valencene-2, and other quinone, quinoline and anthraquinone derivatives. The extracts are thus good candidates to target malignant ER-negative breast cancer, and the identified phytoconstituents could be eluted in further exploratory studies for use in dietary-based anti-breast cancer therapies.	2013
25028400	Dissection of signaling in inflammation: three novel inflammatory regulators.	Uncontrolled inflammation is a feature of autoimmune diseases and autoinflammatory syndromes and may promote tumorigenesis. Thus, identifying molecules that regulate the signaling pathways triggering, mediating, and suppressing inflammation could be helpful in developing new therapeutic approaches for these debilitating diseases. In this review, we present new information on three molecules with important roles in controlling inflammation: MALT1, Ariadne-2, and acetylcholine. We summarize our current state of knowledge of how these molecules function, and how they are involved in pathways of NF-κB activation or vagal nerve stimulation associated with inflammation.	2013
23263278	Loss of Par3 promotes breast cancer metastasis by compromising cell-cell cohesion.	The mechanisms by which tumour cells metastasize and the role that cell polarity proteins play in this process are not well understood. We report that partitioning defective protein 3 (Par3) is dysregulated in metastasis in human breast cancer, and is associated with a higher tumour grade and ErbB2-positive status. Downregulation of Par3 cooperated with ErbB2 to induce cell invasion and metastasis in vivo. Interestingly, the metastatic behaviour was not associated with an overt mesenchymal phenotype. However, loss of Par3 inhibited E-cadherin junction stability, disrupted membrane and actin dynamics at cell-cell junctions and decreased cell-cell cohesion in a manner dependent on the Tiam1/Rac-GTP pathway. Inhibition of this pathway restored E-cadherin junction stability and blocked invasive behaviour of cells lacking Par3, suggesting that loss of Par3 promotes metastatic behaviour of ErbB2-induced tumour epithelial cells by decreasing cell-cell cohesion.	2013
23209155	Diseases associated with defective responses to DNA damage.	Within the last decade, multiple novel congenital human disorders have been described with genetic defects in known and/or novel components of several well-known DNA repair and damage response pathways. Examples include disorders of impaired nucleotide excision repair, DNA double-strand and single-strand break repair, as well as compromised DNA damage-induced signal transduction including phosphorylation and ubiquitination. These conditions further reinforce the importance of multiple genome stability pathways for health and development in humans. Furthermore, these conditions inform our knowledge of the biology of the mechanics of genome stability and in some cases provide potential routes to help exploit these pathways therapeutically. Here, I will review a selection of these exciting findings from the perspective of the disorders themselves, describing how they were identified, how genotype informs phenotype, and how these defects contribute to our growing understanding of genome stability pathways.	2012

23102871	Ischaemic time and fat necrosis in breast reconstruction with a free deep inferior epigastric perforator flap.	Fat tissue can be injured by ischaemia in free flap surgeries, leading to the development of fat necrosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between ischaemic time and fat necrosis in microsurgical breast reconstruction using a deep inferior epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap.	A retrospective chart review was performed for patients who underwent breast reconstruction with free DIEP flaps between June 2009 and November 2011. Data regarding patient demographics, potential risk factors and fat necrosis were collected. Fat necrosis was diagnosed with ultrasound imaging between 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to assess the correlation between ischaemic time and fat necrosis rate. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine a cut-off value for the ischaemic time at which differential fat necrosis rates were maximal.	A total of 86 patients were included in this study. The mean ischaemic time was 89 min, and fat necrosis was diagnosed in 15 patients (17.4%). A significant association was found between ischaemic time and fat necrosis rate on univariate (p-value=0.001) and multivariate analyses (p-value=0.017). The trend analysis of ischaemic time as a categorical variable relative to fat necrosis rate was also significant (p-value<0.001). A threshold value was found whereby patients with an ischaemic time longer than 99.5 min appeared to experience a significantly higher fat necrosis rate than patients with shorter times (p-value=0.005, odds ratio=9.449).	Ischaemic time appears to be significantly associated with increased fat necrosis rate in breast reconstruction using DIEP flaps. A long ischaemia time may be a risk factor for the development of fat necrosis.	2013
23046537	Using association rules mining to explore pattern of Chinese medicinal formulae (prescription) in treating and preventing breast cancer recurrence and metastasis.	Chinese herbal medicine is increasingly widely used as a complementary approach for control of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis. In this paper, we examined the implicit prescription patterns behind the Chinese medicinal formulae, so as to explore the Chinese medicinal compatibility patterns or rules in the treatment or control of breast cancer recurrence and metastasis.	This study was based on the herbs recorded in Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, and the literature sources from Chinese Journal Net and China Master Dissertations Full-text Database (1990 - 2010) to analyze the compatibility rule of the prescription. Each Chinese herb was listed according to the selected medicinal formulae and the added information was organized to establish a database. The frequency and the association rules of the prescription patterns were analyzed using the SPSS Clenmentine Data Mining System. An initial statistical analysis was carried out to categorize the herbs according to their medicinal types and dosage, natures, flavors, channel tropism, and functions. Based on the categorization, the frequencies of occurrence were computed.	The main prescriptive features from the selected formulae of the mining data are: (1) warm or cold herbs in the Five Properties category; sweet or bitter herbs in the Five Flavors category and with affinity to the liver meridian are the most frequently prescribed in the 96 medicinal formulae; (2) herbs with tonifying and replenishing, blood-activating and stasis-resolving, spleen-strengthening and dampness-resolving or heat-clearing and detoxicating functions that are frequently prescribed; (3) herbs with blood-tonifying, yin-tonifying, spleen-strengthening and dampness-resolving, heat-clearing and detoxicating, and blood-activating with stasis-resolving functions that are interrelated and prescribed in combination with qi-tonifying herbs.	The results indicate that there is a close relationship between recurrence and metastasis of breast cancer with liver dysfunctions. These prescriptions focus on the herbs for nourishing the yin-blood, and emolliating and regulating the liver which seems to be the key element in the treatment process. Meanwhile, the use of qi-tonifying and spleen-strengthening herbs also forms the basis of prescription patterns.	2012
23090068	Quantitative assessment of effect of preanalytic cold ischemic time on protein expression in breast cancer tissues.	Companion diagnostic tests can depend on accurate measurement of protein expression in tissues. Preanalytic variables, especially cold ischemic time (time from tissue removal to fixation in formalin) can affect the measurement and may cause false-negative results. We examined 23 proteins, including four commonly used breast cancer biomarker proteins, to quantify their sensitivity to cold ischemia in breast cancer tissues.	A series of 93 breast cancer specimens with known time-to-fixation represented in a tissue microarray and a second series of 25 matched pairs of core needle biopsies and breast cancer resections were used to evaluate changes in antigenicity as a function of cold ischemic time. Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 or Ki67, and 19 other antigens were tested. Each antigen was measured using the AQUA method of quantitative immunofluorescence on at least one series. All statistical tests were two-sided.	We found no evidence for loss of antigenicity with time-to-fixation for ER, PgR, HER2, or Ki67 in a 4-hour time window. However, with a bootstrapping analysis, we observed a trend toward loss for ER and PgR, a statistically significant loss of antigenicity for phosphorylated tyrosine (P = .0048), and trends toward loss for other proteins. There was evidence of increased antigenicity in acetylated lysine, AKAP13 (P = .009), and HIF1A (P = .046), which are proteins known to be expressed in conditions of hypoxia. The loss of antigenicity for phosphorylated tyrosine and increase in expression of AKAP13, and HIF1A were confirmed in the biopsy/resection series.	Key breast cancer biomarkers show no evidence of loss of antigenicity, although this dataset assesses the relatively short time beyond the 1-hour limit in recent guidelines. Other proteins show changes in antigenicity in both directions. Future studies that extend the time range and normalize for heterogeneity will provide more comprehensive information on preanalytic variation due to cold ischemic time.	2012
23038268	Dynein light chain 1 (LC8) association enhances microtubule stability and promotes microtubule bundling.	Dynein Light Chain 1 (LC8) has been shown to pull down tubulin subunits, suggesting that it interacts with microtubules.	LC8 decorates microtubules in vitro and in Drosophila embryos, promotes microtubule assembly, and stabilizes microtubules both in vitro and in tissue-cultured cells.	LC8 stabilizes microtubules.	Data provide the first evidence of a novel MAP-like function of LC8. Dynein light chain 1 (LC8), a highly conserved protein, is known to bind to a variety of different polypeptides. It functions as a dimer, which is inactivated through phosphorylation at the Ser-88 residue. A loss of LC8 function causes apoptosis in Drosophila embryos, and its overexpression induces malignant transformation of breast cancer cells. Here we show that LC8 binds to tubulin, promotes microtubule assembly, and induces the bundling of reconstituted microtubules in vitro. Furthermore, LC8 decorates microtubules both in Drosophila embryos and in HeLa cells, increases the microtubule stability, and promotes microtubule bundling in these cells. Microtubule stability influences a number of different cellular functions including mitosis and cell differentiation. The LC8 overexpression reduces the susceptibility of microtubules to cold and nocodazole-induced depolymerization in tissue-cultured cells and increases microtubule acetylation, suggesting that LC8 stabilizes microtubules. We also show that LC8 knockdown or transfection with inhibitory peptides destabilizes microtubules and inhibits bipolar spindle assembly in HeLa cells. In addition, LC8 knockdown leads to the mitotic block in HeLa cells. Furthermore, molecular docking analysis using the crystal structures of tubulin and LC8 dimer indicated that the latter may bind at α-β tubulin junction in a protofilament at sites distinct from the kinesin and dynein binding sites. Together, we provide the first evidence of a novel microtubule-associated protein-like function of LC8 that could explain its reported roles in cellular metastasis and differentiation.	2012
23028076	Mammary fat pad tumor preparation in mice.	The host microenvironment influences tumor biology, affecting parameters such as gene expression, angiogenesis, growth, invasion, metastasis, and responses to therapy. Consequently, the use of tumor models growing in appropriate orthotopic locations is necessary to obtain a rigorous understanding of tumor pathophysiology and to correctly study antitumor treatments. The mouse mammary fat pad serves as an orthotopic site for breast cancer and can be used to study various aspects of this disease, including the effect of host-tumor interactions on tumor biology and therapeutic response. This protocol describes mammary fat pad tumor preparation in mice.	2012
23028075	Mammary fat pad chamber preparation in mice.	This protocol describes a procedure to implant mammary fat pad chambers in mice. These chambers can then be used for studying breast cancer. In comparison to the classical mammary fat pad flap model, the chamber described here has the advantage of allowing multiple observation time points in the same animal with simple anesthesia.	2012
23025471	Incidence of cancer among residents of high temperature geothermal areas in Iceland: a census based study 1981 to 2010.	Residents of geothermal areas are exposed to geothermal emissions and water containing hydrogen sulphide and radon. We aim to study the association of the residence in high temperature geothermal area with the risk of cancer.	This is an observational cohort study where the population of a high-temperature geothermal area (35,707 person years) was compared with the population of a cold, non-geothermal area (571,509 person years). The cohort originates from the 1981 National Census. The follow up from 1981 to 2010 was based on record linkage by personal identifier with nation-wide death and cancer registries. Through the registries it was possible to ascertain emigration and vital status and to identify the cancer cases, 95% of which had histological verification. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated in Cox-model, adjusted for age, gender, education and housing.	Adjusted HR in the high-temperature geothermal area for all cancers was 1.22 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.42) as compared with the cold area. The HR for pancreatic cancer was 2.85 (95% CI 1.39 to 5.86), breast cancer 1.59 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.31), lymphoid and hematopoietic cancer 1.64 (95% CI 1.00 to 2.66), and non-Hodgkins lymphoma 3.25 (95% CI 1.73 to 6.07). The HR for basal cell carcinoma of the skin was 1.61 (95% CI 1.10 to 2.35). The HRs were increased for cancers of the nasal cavities, larynx, lung, prostate, thyroid gland and for soft tissue sarcoma; however the 95% CIs included unity.	More precise information on chemical and physical exposures are needed to draw firm conclusions from the findings. The significant excess risk of breast cancer, and basal cell carcinoma of the skin, and the suggested excess risk of other radiation-sensitive cancers, calls for measurement of the content of the gas emissions and the hot water, which have been of concern in previous studies in volcanic areas. There are indications of an exposure-response relationship, as the risk was higher in comparison with the cold than with the warm reference area. Social status has been taken into account and data on reproductive factors and smoking habits show that these do not seem to explain the increased risk of cancers, however unknown confounding can not be excluded.	2012
22938449	Cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction and anti-metastatic potential of Oroxylum indicum in human breast cancer cells.	Despite clinical advances in anticancer therapy, there is still a need for novel anticancer metabolites, with higher efficacy and lesser side effects. Oroxylum indicum (L.) Vent. is a small tree of the Bignoniaceae family which is well known for its food and medicinal properties. In present study, the chemopreventive properties of O. indicum hot and cold non-polar extracts (petroleum ether and chloroform) were investigated with MDA- MB-231 (cancer cells) and WRL-68 (non-tumor cells) by XTT assay. All the extracts, and particularly the petroleum ether hot extract (PHO), exhibited significantly (P<0.05) higher cytotoxicity in MDA-MB-231 when compared to WRL-68 cells. PHO was then tested for apoptosis induction in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative (MDA-MB-231) and ER-positive (MCF-7) breast cancer cells by cellular DNA fragmentation ELISA, where it proved more efficient in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, when PHO was tested for anti-metastatic potential in a cell migration inhibition assay, it exhibited beneficial effects. Thus non-polar extracts of O. indicum (especially PHO) can effectively target ER-negative breast cancer cells to induce apoptosis, without harming normal cells by cancer-specific cytotoxicity. Hence, it could be considered as an extract with candidate precursors to possibly harness or alleviate ER-negative breast cancer progression even in advanced stages of malignancy.	2012
22899286	The effect of prolonged cold ischemia time on estrogen receptor immunohistochemistry in breast cancer.	To facilitate accurate detection of estrogen receptor (ER) expression in breast tumors, the American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists recommends that cold ischemia time be kept under 1 h. However, data to address the upper threshold of cold ischemia time are limited. Although it is our routine practice to keep cold ischemia time under 1 h for breast core biopsy specimens, this is difficult for surgical specimens because of the comprehensive intraoperative assessment performed at our institution. In this retrospective study, we compared ER immunohistochemical staining results in paired breast tumor core biopsy specimens and resection specimens with cold ischemia times ranging from 64 to 357 min in 97 patients. The staining category (≥10%, positive; 1-9%, low positive; <1%, negative) between the core biopsy and resection specimens changed for five patients (5%). The weighted Kappa statistic for ER staining category between the two specimen types was 0.86 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.99), indicating good concordance. The difference in the percentage of ER staining between core biopsy and resection was not significantly associated with cold ischemia time (P=0.81, Spearman correlation). Although we did not observe significant associations between the difference in ER staining in the two specimen types and cold ischemia time after placing the patients in three groups of 'increase', 'decrease' and 'no change' using a difference of 25% in ER staining percentage as the cutoff, a trend of decreased ER staining with cold ischemia time >2 h was detected. No statistically significant association was found between the change of ER staining and the history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our findings indicate that prolonged cold ischemia time up to 4 h (97% of our cohort) in the practice setting of our institution has minimal clinical impact on ER immunohistochemical expression in breast tumors.	2013
22899285	Delay to formalin fixation 'cold ischemia time': effect on ERBB2 detection by in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.	The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists ERBB2 testing guidelines address several pre-analytical variables known to affect ERBB2 testing accuracy. According to 2010 updated guidelines, the pre-analytical variable of time to tissue fixation (cold ischemia time) should be kept to <1 h, however, little has been published about cold ischemia time and its significance in ERBB2 testing. To that end, this study evaluated ERBB2 status using two different FDA-approved in-situ hybridization methods and an FDA-approved immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay in the largest cohort to date (n=84) of invasive breast carcinomas with tracked cold ischemia time. Cold ischemia time was stratified into four groups (<1 h (n=45), 1-2 h (n=27), 2-3 h (n=6), and >3 h (n=6)) and ERBB2 status was evaluated in each group by IHC (4B5) and by in-situ hybridization methodologies (PathVysion(®) fluorescence in situ hybridization and the INFORM HER2(®) dual in situ DNA probe assay). Both in-situ hybridization methods were evaluated using three ERBB2 scoring criteria (dual-probe guidelines, single-probe guidelines, and the FDA package insert scoring instructions). Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) and INFORM HER2(®) demonstrated 100% concordance in the detection of ERBB2 amplification by all three scoring guidelines at all cold ischemia time points. Agreement between in-situ hybridization methodologies and IHC was superior using single-probe guidelines compared with dual probe or FDA scoring instructions. In addition, Inform HER2(®) in-situ hybridization signals were significantly more intense than FISH at all cold ischemia time points, however, no significant loss of either chromosome 17 or ERBB2 signal was detected by FISH or Inform HER2(®) in-situ hybridization in cold ischemia times up to 3 h. On the basis of our findings, cold ischemia time up to 3 h has no deleterious effect on the detection of ERBB2 via in-situ hybridization or IHC.	2013
22890802	3D dosimetry in patients with early breast cancer undergoing Intraoperative Avidination for Radionuclide Therapy (IART) combined with external beam radiation therapy.	Intraoperative Avidination for Radionuclide Therapy (IART) is a novel targeted radionuclide therapy recently used in patients with early breast cancer. It is a radionuclide approach with (90)Y-biotin combined with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to release a boost of radiation in the tumour bed. Two previous clinical trials using dosimetry based on the calculation of mean absorbed dose values with the hypothesis of uniform activity distribution (MIRD 16 method) assessed the feasibility and safety of IART. In the present retrospective study, a voxel dosimetry analysis was performed to investigate heterogeneity in distribution of the absorbed dose. The aim of this work was to compare dosimetric and radiobiological evaluations derived from average absorbed dose vs. voxel absorbed dose approaches.	We evaluated 14 patients who were injected with avidin into the tumour bed after conservative surgery and 1 day later received an intravenous injection of 3.7 GBq of (90)Y-biotin (together with 185 MBq (111)In-biotin for imaging). Sequential images were used to estimate the absorbed dose in the target region according to the standard dosimetry method (SDM) and the voxel dosimetry method (VDM). The biologically effective dose (BED) distribution was also evaluated. Dose/volume and BED volume histograms were generated to derive equivalent uniform BED (EUBED) and equivalent uniform dose (EUD) values.	No "cold spots" were highlighted by voxel dosimetry. The median absorbed-dose in the target region was 20 Gy (range 15-27 Gy) by SDM, and the median EUD was 20.4 Gy (range 16.5-29.4 Gy) by the VDM; SDM and VDM estimates differed by about 6 %. The EUD/mean voxel absorbed dose ratio was >0.9 in all patients, indicative of acceptable uniformity in the target. The median BED and EUBED values were 21.8 Gy (range 15.9-29.3 Gy) and 22.8 Gy (range 17.3-31.8 Gy), respectively.	VDM highlighted the absence of significant heterogeneity in absorbed dose in the target. The EUD/mean absorbed dose ratio indicated a biological efficacy comparable to that of uniform distribution of absorbed dose. The VDM is recommended for improving accuracy, taking into account actual activity distribution in the target region. The radiobiological model applied allowed us to compare the effects of IART® with those of EBRT and to match the two irradiation modalities.	2012

22851698	Expression profiling during mammary epithelial cell three-dimensional morphogenesis identifies PTPRO as a novel regulator of morphogenesis and ErbB2-mediated transformation.	Identification of genes that are upregulated during mammary epithelial cell morphogenesis may reveal novel regulators of tumorigenesis. We have demonstrated that gene expression programs in mammary epithelial cells grown in monolayer cultures differ significantly from those in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. We identify a protein tyrosine phosphate, PTPRO, that was upregulated in mature MCF-10A mammary epithelial 3D structures but had low to undetectable levels in monolayer cultures. Downregulation of PTPRO by RNA interference inhibited proliferation arrest during morphogenesis. Low levels of PTPRO expression correlated with reduced survival for breast cancer patients, suggesting a tumor suppressor function. Furthermore, we showed that the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2/HER2 is a direct substrate of PTPRO and that loss of PTPRO increased ErbB2-induced cell proliferation and transformation, together with tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB2. Moreover, in patients with ErbB2-positive breast tumors, low PTPRO expression correlated with poor clinical prognosis compared to ErbB2-positive patients with high levels of PTPRO. Thus, PTPRO is a novel regulator of ErbB2 signaling, a potential tumor suppressor, and a novel prognostic marker for patients with ErbB2-positive breast cancers. We have identified the protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPRO as a regulator of three-dimensional epithelial morphogenesis of mammary epithelial cells and as a regulator of ErbB2-mediated transformation. In addition, we demonstrated that ErbB2 is a direct substrate of PTPRO and that decreased expression of PTPRO predicts poor prognosis for ErbB2-positive breast cancer patients. Thus, our results identify PTPRO as a novel regulator of mammary epithelial transformation, a potential tumor suppressor, and a predictive biomarker for breast cancer.	2012
22828996	A novel PET protocol for visualization of breast cancer resistance protein function at the blood-brain barrier.	Breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) is the most abundant multidrug efflux transporter at the human blood-brain barrier (BBB), restricting brain distribution of various drugs. In this study, we developed a positron emission tomography (PET) protocol to visualize Bcrp function at the murine BBB, based on the dual P-glycoprotein (P-gp)/Bcrp substrate radiotracer [(11)C]tariquidar in combination with the Bcrp inhibitor Ko143. To eliminate the contribution of P-gp efflux to [(11)C]tariquidar brain distribution, we studied mice in which P-gp was genetically knocked out (Mdr1a/b((-/-)) mice) or chemically knocked out by pretreatment with cold tariquidar. We found that [(11)C]tariquidar brain uptake increased dose dependently after administration of escalating doses of Ko143, both in Mdr1a/b((-/-)) mice and in tariquidar pretreated wild-type mice. After 15 mg/kg Ko143, the maximum increase in [(11)C]tariquidar brain uptake relative to baseline scans was 6.3-fold in Mdr1a/b((-/-)) mice with a half-maximum effect dose of 4.98 mg/kg and 3.6-fold in tariquidar (8 mg/kg) pretreated wild-type mice, suggesting that the presented protocol is sensitive to visualize a range of different functional Bcrp activities at the murine BBB. We expect that this protocol can be translated to the clinic, because tariquidar can be safely administered to humans at doses that completely inhibit cerebral P-gp.	2012
22775420	Investigation of the cytocidal potential of Rhinella jimi skin methanol extracts.	Amphibian skins have wide variety of biologically active compounds associated with the natural defenses of these animals.	To study the in vitro anticancer activity of methanol extracts of the skin of Rhinella jimi Stevaux (Anura: Bufonidae).	The extract was obtained by cold methanol extraction for 96 h using dried skins (295 mg). The methanol skin extract was dried under reduced pressure, giving a 5.5% yield. In order to test for growth-inhibitory activity, in vitro tests were performed with the following cancer cell lines using concentrations ranging between 0.25-250 µg/mL of the extract by 48 h: K562 (leukemia), MCF-7 (breast), NCI-ADR (breast with MDR phenotype), UACC-62 (melanoma), NCI460 (lung), PCO3 (prostate), HT-29 (colon), OVCAR (ovary), and 786-0 (kidney).	The methanol extract of R. jimi produced a growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner against the most of the assayed cell lines. In addition to the growth inhibition, the extract induced the cell death in the ovary and colon lines (EC₅₀ 0.125 and 0.2 µg/mL, respectively), demonstrating 100% of inhibition with 2.5 µg/mL. However, prostate and leukemia cell lines demonstrated less sensitivity, with EC₅₀ of 24 and 235 µg/mL, respectively. This is the first report about the anticancer activity by natural products from the skin of R. jimi.	The methanol extracts of R. jimi significantly affected the growth of several cell lines, demonstrating that these compounds are a potential source of substances that could be utilized in cancer treatments.	2012

22750847	DDX5 regulates DNA replication and is required for cell proliferation in a subset of breast cancer cells.	Understanding factors required for DNA replication will enrich our knowledge of this important process and potentially identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited in cancer therapy. We applied an assay that measures the stability of maintenance of an episomal plasmid in human tissue culture cells to screen for new DNA replication factors. We identify an important role for DDX5 in G(1)-S-phase progression where it directly regulates DNA replication factor expression by promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to E2F-regulated gene promoters. We find that the DDX5 locus is frequently amplified in breast cancer and that breast cancer-derived cells with amplification of DDX5 are much more sensitive to its depletion than breast cancer cells and a breast epithelial cell line that lacks DDX5 amplification. Our results show a novel role for DDX5 in cancer cell proliferation and suggest DDX5 as a therapeutic target in breast cancer treatment.	DDX5 is required for cell proliferation by controlling the transcription of genes expressing DNA replication proteins in cancer cells in which the DDX5 locus is amplified, and this has uncovered a dependence on DDX5 for cell proliferation. Given the high frequency of DDX5 amplification in breast cancer, our results highlight DDX5 as a promising candidate for targeted therapy of breast tumors with DDX5 amplification, and indeed we show that DDX5 inhibition sensitizes a subset of breast cancer cells to trastuzumab.	2012
22661590	Wnt signaling in mammary glands: plastic cell fates and combinatorial signaling.	The mouse mammary gland is an outstanding developmental model that exemplifies the activities of many of the effector pathways known to organize mammalian morphogenesis; furthermore, there are well-characterized methods for the specific genetic manipulation of various mammary epithelial cell components. Among these signaling pathways, Wnt signaling has been shown to generate plasticity of fate determination, expanding the genetic programs available to cells in the mammary lineage. It is responsible first for the appearance of the mammary fate in embryonic ectoderm and then for maintaining bi-potential basal stem cells in adult mammary ductal trees. Recent technical developments have led to the separate analysis of various mammary epithelial cell subpopulations, spurring the investigation of Wnt-dependent interactions. Although Wnt signaling was shown to be oncogenic for mouse mammary epithelium even before being identified as the principle oncogenic driver for gut epithelium, conclusive data implicating this pathway as a tumor driver for breast cancer lag behind, and we examine potential reasons.	2012
28518505	SU-E-T-528: Appraisal of Acorus XB and Convolution Dose Algorithms in Field Junction of Breast Tangential/superclavicular Fields.	Dose accuracy injunction regions of breast-tangential therapy is a challenge, and inaccurate dose predictions may lead to unreal hot/cold spots. Availability of the novel deterministic radiation transport method Acuros XB (AXB) provides a potential for more accurate dose predictions. This study assesses relative dose accuracies of this and the widely used other algorithms: collapsed cone convolution (CCC) and anisotropic analytical algorithm (AAA) against film measurements.	A typical tangential and superclav fileld combination was planned for an anthropomorphic body phantom using Pinnacle-9.0 treatment-planning system (TPS). The created plan employing 6MV beam was delivered to the phantom on a Varian linac. In region of the field junction of tangentials & superclav, films (EBT2) were placed in coronal planes at two depths (∼ 2 and 4 cm). Optical density was measured along and ± 5mm away from the field-match line, and converted to dose using film-calibration curve specific to the batch of film. The same plan was also imported to Eclipse TPS using an import filter written in MATLAB. Algorithms Pinnacle CCC 9.0, Eclipse AAA 10.0.24 and AXB 11.0.3 were used for calculations. Comparison of the measured doses (assumed as gold standard) against doses calculated from planning-systems were preformed in a MATLAB platform.	In general, dose distributions from all three TPS algorithms are found to agree closely with film data. Agreements between AXB and CCC dose calculations were found to be reasonable. AXB appears to be better in modeling the backscatter effects in the heterogeneous regions. AAA calculations gives acceptable results, but with less accuracy compared to CCC and AXB.	The novel deterministic algorithm AXB in Eclipse is found to provide better agreement with measured data in breast-tangential therapy. Benefits of using Acuors XB algorithm in tangential fields planning requires further investigation. This work was funded by National Institutes of Health through grant 2R44CA105806-02 and MD Andersonâ€™s Cancer Center Support Grant CA0 16672.	2012
22638684	Tissue banking in a regional hospital: a promising future concept? First report on fresh frozen tissue banking in a hospital without an integrated institute of pathology.	Vital tissue provided by fresh frozen tissue banking is often required for genetic tumor profiling and tailored therapies. However, the potential patient benefits of fresh frozen tissue banking are currently limited to university hospitals. The objective of the present pilot study--the first one in the literature--was to evaluate whether fresh frozen tissue banking is feasible in a regional hospital without an integrated institute of pathology.	Patients with resectable breast and colon cancer were included in this prospective study. Both malignant and healthy tissue were sampled using isopentan-based snap-freezing 1 h after tumor resection and stored at -80 °C before transfer to the main tissue bank of a University institute of pathology.	The initial costs to set up tissue banking were 35,662 US$. Furthermore, the running costs are 1,250 US$ yearly. During the first 13 months, 43 samples (nine samples of breast cancer and 34 samples of colon cancer) were collected from 41 patients. Based on the pathology reports, there was no interference with standard histopathologic analyses due to the sample collection.	This is the first report in the literature providing evidence that tissue banking in a regional hospital without an integrated institute of pathology is feasible. The interesting findings of the present pilot study must be confirmed by larger investigations.	2012

22562477	The interference of cold ischemia time in the quality of total RNA from frozen tumor samples.	Tumor Banks were created to organize the collection, storage and distribution of biological samples from oncological patients, facilitating its use in cancer research. To ensure the quality of the samples from our bank, we implemented standard operating procedures international. In order to evaluate the influence of cold ischemia time (time between surgical removal of the specimen and the snap freezing of the sample) on the quality of the samples (evaluated by measurement integrity of their RNA), collected during 10 months two tumor samples from each donor, one with up to 30 min of cold ischemia and other with exact 45 min, totaling 100 different donors and 200 samples, 40 from each of the following organs: breast, thyroid, stomach, lung and colorectum. We extracted total RNA from the samples and with the aid of a Bioanalyser, evaluate their quality, comparing it with cold ischemia times in different organs. Among the samples up to 30 min and the samples with exact 45 min, we respectively found 63 (64.3 %) and 36 (36 %) with intact RNA, 11 (11.2 %) and 17 (17 %) partially degraded and 24 (24.5 %) and 47 (47 %) degraded (p < 0.001). Thyroid and colorectal samples were more sensitive to variations in cold ischemia time (p = 0.006 and p = 0.03, respectively). Stomach and lungs were less sensitive (p = 0.919 and p = 0.384, respectively). We concluded that the cold ischemia time up to 30 min was more efficient to maintain the integrity of RNA in most samples, and that RNA degradation varied according to the different topographies.	2013

22519890	Positron emission tomography imaging of tumor angiogenesis with a 66Ga-labeled monoclonal antibody.	The goal of this study was to develop a (66)Ga-based positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for noninvasive imaging of CD105 expression during tumor angiogenesis, a hallmark of cancer. (66)Ga was produced using a cyclotron with (nat)Zn or isotopically enriched (66)Zn targets. TRC105, a chimeric anti-CD105 monoclonal antibody, was conjugated to 2-S-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA) and labeled with (66)Ga. No difference in CD105 binding affinity or specificity was observed between TRC105 and NOTA-TRC105 based on flow cytometry analysis. Reactivity of (66)Ga for NOTA, corrected to the end of bombardment, was between 74 and 222 GBq/μmol for both target enrichments with <2 ppb of cold gallium. (66)Ga-labeling was achieved with >80% radiochemical yield. Serial PET imaging revealed that the murine breast cancer 4T1 tumor uptake of (66)Ga-NOTA-TRC105 was 5.9 ± 1.6, 8.5 ± 0.6, and 9.0 ± 0.6% ID/g at 4, 20, and 36 h postinjection, respectively (n = 4). At the last time point, tumor uptake was higher than that of all organs, which gave excellent tumor contrast with a tumor/muscle ratio of 10.1 ± 1.1. Biodistribution data as measured by gamma counting were consistent with the PET findings. Blocking experiment, control studies with (66)Ga-NOTA-cetuximab, as well as ex vivo histology all confirmed the in vivo target specificity of (66)Ga-NOTA-TRC105. Successful PET imaging with high specific activity (66)Ga (>700 GBq/μmol has been achieved) as the radiolabel opens many new possibilities for future PET research with antibodies or other targeting ligands.	2012
22517694	Dynamic MRI-derived parameters for hot and cold spots: correlation with breast cancer histopathology.	To identify the dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) imaging features that may predict the outcome of patients with breast cancer.	DCE-MR images from 87 patients newly diagnosed with primary breast cancer were reviewed. The kinetic parameters (including cold spot, hot spot, and heterogeneity parameters) were derived from the DCE-MRI data. These parameters were used to thoroughly reflect the tumor status. The association of dynamic MR features (including kinetic and morphological features) with established prognostic indicators was evaluated.	Malignant tumors with poor histomorphological indicators showed higher values of hot spot parameters (maximal initial Slope [maxSlope(i)] and maximal Washout [maxWashout]), higher values of a heterogeneity parameter- initial slope ratio (Slope(i) ratio) and lower values of a cold spot parameter (minimal initial slope [minSlope(iM)]) than those with favorable prognostic indicators. The heterogeneous internal enhancement pattern and rim-like enhancement pattern were more frequently observed in patients with poor prognostic indicators. Moreover, binary logistic regression analysis showed that kinetic parameters Slope(i) ratio (p=0.021), minSlope(i) (p=0.024), internal homogeneity (p=0.001), and maxSlope(iM) (p<0.001) were independently and significantly associated with histological grade, lymph node status, tumor size, and Ki-67, respectively.	Our results suggest that all hot spot, cold spot, and heterogeneity parameters may be useful to noninvasively identify highly aggressive breast carcinomas. More importantly, cold spot and heterogeneity parameters may serve as crucial indicators to predict the outcome of breast cancer.
22517571	Upper-limb lymphedema treated aesthetically with lymphaticovenous anastomosis using indocyanine green lymphography and noncontact vein visualization.	We have described a procedure to minimize surgical wounds, in which lymph vessels and skin venules are identified by indocyanine green (ICG) lymphography and the AV300 noncontact visualization system (AccuVein, Cold Spring Harbor, NY), respectively. This approach allows accurate decisions regarding sites of incision for lymphatic venous anastomosis (LVA). This method was applied in a patient with right upper-limb lymphedema after breast cancer therapy. The low-invasive procedure can be used before and during surgery. The incision size is minimal, and the incision site is at the joint area. Thus, we aim to establish this approach as a standard method for identifying lymph vessels and veins that are suitable for LVA. This innovative vascular-imaging machine makes LVA less invasive and more effective without side effects.	2012
22495358	Delay to formalin fixation alters morphology and immunohistochemistry for breast carcinoma.	Delay to formalin fixation (DFF) also known as cold ischemia has been known to have an adverse effect on breast biomarkers. The aim of the study was to further evaluate the effect of DFF on tumor histomorphology and immunohistochemistry.	Ten palpable invasive breast carcinomas were resected and underwent immediate gross evaluation. For each case, the procured tumor was divided into 8 equal parts and consecutively fixed after 0, 10, and 30 minutes, 1, 2, 4, and 8 hours; 1 section was kept in saline and stored overnight at 4°C. Stains normally used in breast pathology including epidermal growth factor receptor, Ki-67, p53, AE 1/3, CAM-5.2, cytokeratin (CK)7, CK14, CK5/6, epithelial membrane antigen, E-cadherin, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, and mammaglobin were studied. The change was considered significant if it had any pathologic or clinical consequence.	DFF had spurious effect on 9 of 10 cases. However, significant alteration that affected the histomorphologic interpretation was observed in 3 cases. Significant immunohistochemistry alteration was seen only in the membranous markers (epidermal growth factor receptor and E-cadherin). Although the quality of the cytoplasmic markers was affected, the interpretation (positive vs. negative) was not affected by DFF. Ki-67 had minimal but insignificant change. Generally, these changes occurred at or after 2-hour mark.	Therefore, specimens should be fixed within 1 hour from tissue harvesting and not stored without fixation overnight.	2012
22460807	The effect of cold ischemic time on the immunohistochemical evaluation of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2 expression in invasive breast carcinoma.	The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologist (ASCO/CAP) guidelines on breast cancer currently recommend a cold ischemic time of <1 h, although data are limited. Breast resection specimens were subjected to variable cold ischemic time periods (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 24, and 48 h) within the refrigerator and at room temperature. The study included 25 tumors, all of which had refrigerated samples. Non-refrigerated samples (samples at room temperature) were present on 23 cases. Hormone receptors were semi-quantitatively scored using the H-score method. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene ERBB2 (HER2) was scored using the ASCO/CAP guidelines. The results were compared with the core biopsy scores, which have negligible cold ischemic time period before fixation. Mild reduction in staining for hormone receptors was judged present if the H-score on the resection specimen was between one-half and three-fourth of the H-score at core biopsy. Significant reduction was judged present when the H-score on resection was less than one-half of the core biopsy H-score. Mild reduction in HER2 staining was judged present if there was one-step reduction; and significant reduction was judged present if there was two-step reduction in staining. A true reduction was judged present only when the reduction was consistently present for the increasing time interval. A focal reduction for a particular time sample was attributed to the heterogeneity of the tumor sample. Non-refrigerated samples are affected more by prolonged cold ischemic time than refrigerated samples. Cold ischemic time period of as short as one-half hour may occasionally impact the immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for progesterone receptor. Significant reduction in IHC staining for hormone receptors, and HER2, however, generally does not result until 4 h for refrigerated samples and 2 h for non-refrigerated samples. The ASCO/CAP guideline of cold ischemic time period of <1 h is a prudent guideline to follow.	2012
22454675	The Antiproliferative Activity of Sclerotia of Lignosus rhinocerus (Tiger Milk Mushroom).	Lignosus rhinocerus, the tiger milk mushroom, is one of the most important medicinal mushrooms used by the indigenous people of Southeast Asia and China. It has been used to treat breast cancer. A cold water extract (LR-CW) prepared from the sclerotia of L. rhinocerus cultivar was found to exhibit antiproliferative activity against human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and human lung carcinoma (A549), with IC(50) of 96.7 μg/mL and 466.7 μg/mL, respectively. In comparison, LR-CW did not show significant cytotoxicity against the two corresponding human normal cells, 184B5 (human breast cell) and NL 20 (human lung cell). DNA fragmentation studies suggested that the cytotoxic action of LR-CW against cancer cells is mediated by apoptosis. Sephadex G-50 gel filtration fractionation of LR-CW yielded a high-molecular-weight and a low-molecular-weight fraction. The high-molecular-weight fraction contains mainly carbohydrate (68.7%) and small amount of protein (3.6%), whereas the low-molecular-weight fraction contains 31% carbohydrate and was devoid of protein. Only the high-molecular-weight fraction exhibited antiproliferative activity against cancer cells, with IC(50) of 70.0 μg/mL and 76.7 μg/mL, respectively. Thus, the cytotoxic action of the LR-CW is due to the high-molecular-weight fraction, either the proteins or protein-carbohydrate complex.	2012
22398989	Predictors of serum vitamin D levels in African American and European American men in Chicago.	Vitamin D deficiency is epidemiologically linked to prostate, breast, and colon cancer. When compared with European American (EA) men, African American (AA) men have increased risk of prostate cancer, but few studies evaluate vitamin D status in AA men. The authors evaluate the biological and environmental predictors of vitamin D deficiency in AA and EA men in Chicago, Illinois, a low ultraviolet radiation environment. Blood samples were collected from 492 men, aged between 40 and 79 years, from urology clinics at three hospitals in Chicago, along with demographic and medical information, body mass index, and skin melanin content using a portable narrow-band reflectometer. Vitamin D intake and ultraviolet radiation exposure were assessed using validated questionnaires. The results demonstrated that Black race, cold season of blood draw, elevated body mass index, and lack of vitamin D supplementation increase the risk of vitamin D deficiency. Supplementation is a high-impact, modifiable risk factor. Race and sunlight exposure should be taken into account for recommended daily allowances for vitamin D intake.	2012

22367655	Computational prediction of state anxiety in Asian patients with cancer susceptible to chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting.	State anxiety, a risk factor for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), is a subjective symptom and difficult to quantify. Clinicians need appropriate anxiety measures to assess patients' risks of CINV. This study aimed to determine the anxiety characteristics that can predict CINV based on computational analysis of an objective assessment tool. A single-center, prospective, observational study was carried out between January 2007 and July 2010. Patients with breast, head and neck, and gastrointestinal cancers were recruited and treated with a variety of chemotherapy protocols and appropriate antiemetics. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting characteristics and antiemetic use were recorded using a standardized diary, whereas patients' anxiety characteristics were evaluated using the Beck Anxiety Inventory. Principal component (PC) analysis was performed to analyze the anxiety characteristics. A subset known as principal variables, which had the highest PC weightings, was identified for patients with and without complete response, complete protection, and complete control. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting events and anxiety characteristics of 710 patients were collated; 51%, 30%, and 20% were on anthracycline-, oxaliplatin-, and cisplatin-based therapies, respectively. Most patients suffered from delayed CINV, with decreasing proportions achieving complete response (58%), complete protection (42%), and complete control (27%). Seven symptoms (fear of dying, fear of the worst, unable to relax, hot/cold sweats, nervousness, faintness, numbness) were identified as potential CINV predictors. This study demonstrates the usefulness of PC analysis, an unsupervised machine learning technique, to identify 7 anxiety characteristics that are useful as clinical CINV predictors. Clinicians should be aware of these characteristics when assessing CINV in patients on emetogenic chemotherapies.	2012
22278362	Expression of the SEPT9_i4 isoform confers resistance to microtubule-interacting drugs.	The evolutionarily conserved septin family of genes encode GTP binding proteins involved in a variety of cellular functions including cytokinesis, apoptosis, membrane dynamics and vesicle trafficking. Septin proteins can form hetero-oligomeric complexes and interact with other proteins including actin and tubulin. The human SEPT9 gene on chromosome 17q25.3 has a complex genomic architecture with 18 different transcripts that can encode 15 distinct polypeptides. Two distinct transcripts with unique 5' ends (SEPT9_v4 and SEPT9_v4*) encode the same protein. In tumours the ratio of these transcripts changes with elevated levels of SEPT9_v4* mRNA, a transcript that is translated with enhanced efficiency leading to increased SEPT9_i4 protein.	We have examined the effect of over-expression of SEPT9_i4 on the dynamics of microtubule polymer mass in cultured cells.	We show that the microtubule network in SEPT9_i4 over-expressing cells resists disruption by paclitaxel or cold incubation but also repolymerises tubulin more slowly after microtubule depolymerisation. Finally we show that SEPT9_i4 over-expressing cells have enhanced survival in the presence of clinically relevant microtubule acting drugs but not after treatment with DNAinteracting agents.	Given that SEPT9 over-expression is seen in diverse tumours and in particular ovarian and breast cancer, such data indicate that SEPT9_v4 expression may be clinically relevant and contribute to some forms of drug resistance.	2012
22245967	The splicing factor SRSF1 regulates apoptosis and proliferation to promote mammary epithelial cell transformation.	The splicing-factor oncoprotein SRSF1 (also known as SF2/ASF or ASF/SF2) is upregulated in breast cancers. We investigated the ability of SRSF1 to transform human and mouse mammary epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro. SRSF1-overexpressing COMMA-1D cells formed tumors, following orthotopic transplantation to reconstitute the mammary gland. In three-dimensional (3D) culture, SRSF1-overexpressing MCF-10A cells formed larger acini than control cells, reflecting increased proliferation and delayed apoptosis during acinar morphogenesis. These effects required the first RNA-recognition motif and nuclear functions of SRSF1. SRSF1 overexpression promoted alternative splicing of BIM (also known as BCL2L11) and BIN1 to produce isoforms that lack pro-apoptotic functions and contribute to the phenotype. Finally, SRSF1 cooperated specifically with MYC to transform mammary epithelial cells, in part by potentiating eIF4E activation, and these cooperating oncogenes are significantly coexpressed in human breast tumors. Thus, SRSF1 can promote breast cancer, and SRSF1 itself or its downstream effectors may be valuable targets for the development of therapeutics.	2012
22214432	Experimental α-particle radioimmunotherapy of breast cancer using 227Th-labeled p-benzyl-DOTA-trastuzumab.	The aim of the present study was to explore the biodistribution, normal tissue toxicity, and therapeutic efficacy of the internalizing low-dose rate alpha-particle-emitting radioimmunoconjugate 227Th-trastuzumab in mice with HER2-expressing breast cancer xenografts.	Biodistribution of 227Th-trastuzumab and 227Th-rituximab in nude mice bearing SKBR-3 xenografts were determined at different time points after injection. Tumor growth was measured after administration of 227Th-trastuzumab, 227Th-rituximab, cold trastuzumab, and saline. The toxicity of 227Th-trastuzumab was evaluated by measurements of body weight, blood cell, and clinical chemistry parameters, as well as histological examination of tissue specimens.	The tumor uptake reached peak levels of 34% ID/g (4.6 kBq/g) 3 days after injection of 400 kBq/kg of 227Th-trastuzumab. The absorbed radiation dose to tumor was 2.9 Gy, while it was 2.4 Gy to femur due to uptake of the daughter nuclide 223Ra in bone; the latter already explored in clinical phases I and II trials without serious toxicity. A significant dose-dependent antitumor effect was observed for dosages of 200, 400, and 600 kBq/kg of 227Th-trastuzumab but no effect of 400 and 600 kBq/kg 227Th-rituximab (non-tumor binding). No serious delayed bone marrow or normal organ toxicity was observed, but there was a statistical significant reduction in blood cell parameters for the highest-dose group of 227Th-trastuzumab treatment.	Internalizing 227Th-trastuzumab therapy was well tolerated and resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of breast cancer xenograft growth. These results warrant further preclinical studies aiming at a clinical trial in breast cancer patients with metastases to bone.	2011
22213219	Effects of cold ischemia and inflammatory tumor microenvironment on detection of PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway activation patterns in clinical cancer samples.	The accuracy of common markers for PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathway activation in preclinical and clinical cancer biomarker studies depends on phosphoepitope stability and changes of phosphorylation under ischemia. Herein, we define conditions under which phosphoepitope-specific duplex immunohistochemistry (IHC) on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues reflects pathway activation in situ as accurately as possible, and identify activation patterns linked to mutational status, pathway dependency and tumor microenvironment in clinical tumor samples, cell culture and xenograft tissues. Systematically assessing robustness of pAKT, pERK1/2, pMEK1/2 and pmTOR detection and related markers in xenograft tissues exposed to ischemia, we show that control of preprocessing and ischemia times allows accurate interpretation of staining results. Phosphorylation patterns were then analyzed in 33 xenograft models and in 58 cases with breast cancer, including 21 paired samples of core-needle biopsies with corresponding mastectomy specimens, and 37 mastectomy samples obtained under rigorously controlled conditions minimizing ischemia time. Patterns of pAKT and pERK1/2 staining (predominant PI3K/AKT, predominant MAPK and concomitant activation) were associated with sensitivity to pathway inhibition and partially with the mutational status in cell lines and corresponding xenograft tumors. In contrast, no clear correlation between mutational status and staining patterns was observed in clinical breast cancer samples, suggesting that interaction with the human tumor microenvironment may interfere with the use of phosphoepitope-specific IHC as potential markers for pathway dependency. In contrast to core needle biopsies, surgically resected breast cancer samples showed evidence of severe signal changes comparable to those effects observed in xenograft tumors exposed to controlled ischemia.	2012
24377005	Segmented photon beams technique for irradiation of postmastectomy patients.	To present the segmented photon beams technique (SPBT) for irradiation of postmastectomy patients.	In majority of techniques for irradiation of posmastectomy patients, a few adjacent photon or electron beams were usually implemented in order to encompass different parts of the target. In the presented SPBT technique, the radiotherapy plan consists of 6 isocentric photon beams and the area CTV includes both the chest wall and the supraclavicular area. This makes it possible to provide a uniform dose to the CTV with no hot and cold points and enables the determination of doses for the entire volume of critical organs.	The treatment forward-IMRT plan comprises six isocentric 4 and 15 MV photon beams. Modulation of the dose distribution for each field was obtained by applying three segments on average. The total dose of 45 Gy was administered in 20 fractions. Dose distributions in target volume and organs at risk were evaluated for 70 randomly chosen patients.	On average, 94.8% of the CTV volume received doses within 95-107% of the prescribed dose. The average volume of the heart receiving a dose of 30 Gy and lager was 2% for patients with left breast cancer. The average dose to the lung on the irradiation side was always lower than 15.5 Gy and the average V20 Gy was below 35.5%.	The SPBT complies with requirements for high dose homogeneity within the target volume and satisfactory level of sparing of organs at risk.	2012
22169574	Dynamic breast magnetic resonance imaging: pretreatment prediction of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) may have the potential of predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer. However, most of these studies focused on evaluating hot-spot characteristics. To thoroughly reflect tumor status, the cold spot and heterogeneity characteristics should also be evaluated.	DCE-MRIs from 60 patients newly diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer were reviewed. Kinetic parameters (including cold spot, hot spot, and heterogeneity parameters) derived from DCE-MRI data were used to describe cold spot, hot spot, and heterogeneity features. Patients with a pathologic complete response (pCR) or a ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion after chemotherapy were categorized into the pCR group. Pretreatment kinetic parameters in the pCR and non-pCR groups were compared by using univariate tests. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors for pCR. The best cutoff value of the independent predictor at pretreatment, with which to differentiate between patients who had a pCR and a non-pCR, was calculated by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.	After chemotherapy, 10 (16.7%) patients were categorized into the pCR group and 50 (83.3%) into non-pCR group. Multivariate analysis showed that pretreatment washout slope at a cold spot (washout(C)) was the only significant and independent predictor of pCR (β = 26.128; P = .005). The best pretreatment washout(C) cutoff value with which to differentiate between patients who had pCR and those with non-pCR was 0.0277, which yielded a sensitivity of 80.0% (95% CI, 44.4%-97.5%) and a specificity of 74.0% (95% CI, 59.7%-85.4%).	Washout(C) may be used as a predictor for pCR in patients with breast cancer who undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy.	2012
22160948	Anticancer effects of 5-fluorouracil combined with warming and relieving cold phlegm formula on human breast cancer.	To investigate the anticancer effects of warming and relieving cold phlegm formula (, WRCP), a Chinese medical mixture composed of the aqueous extracts of Aconitum carmichaeli, Rhizoma bolbostemmatis, Phytolacca acinosa, Panax notoginseng, and Gekko swinhonis Gūenther, combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on human breast cancer in vivo.	Seventy-two Nu/Nu mice inoculated with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were randomized into the control group, 5-FU group, high-dose WRCP (hWRCP) group, medium-dose WRCP (mWRCP) group, low-dose WRCP (lWRCP) group, or combination of mWRCP and 5-FU group in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio. Drug administration was commenced on the day following tumor implantation. The control group was injected daily with normal saline (N.S.) intraperitoneally; the 5-FU group was injected with 5-FU at 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally every third day for a total of 7 treatments; the hWRCP group, mWRCP group and lWRCP group received daily doses of 5, 1, and 0.2 g/kg of WRCP, respectively, by gastric perfusion; and the combination group was treated with 5-FU plus mWRCP on the same schedules as above. All treatments lasted for 22 days. Tumor volume, tumor weight, inhibition rate of tumor weight, necrosis rate of tumor, organ index, and change in body weight of nude mice were measured.	The combination group and the hWRCP group had significantly smaller tumor volumes (580±339 mm(3) and 587±249 mm(3) versus 1055±234 mm(3), respectively), lower tumor weights (0.42±0.29 g and 0.52±0.29 g versus 0.80±0.15 g, respectively), and higher tumor necrosis rates (22.7% and 25.6% versus 9.4%, respectively) as compared with the control group (all <0.05). Similar changes were found in the 5-FU, mWRCP, and lWRCP groups when compared with the control group but were not statistically significant, except for the tumor weight for the 5-FU group. The combination group and the hWRCP group had significantly smaller tumor volumes compared with the 5-FU group (778±202 mm(3), both <0.05). The combination group had the highest tumor inhibition rate (47.7%), followed by the hWRCP group (35.2%) and 5-FU group (28.3%). The 5-FU group had a lower body weight increase (1.37±2.06 g versus 5.60±0.72 g, <0.05) and a lower spleen index (4.064±1.774 mg/10 g versus 5.294±1.796 mg/10 g) as compared with the control group, whereas the combination group reversed the changes in the 5-FU group with the body weight increase of 3.52±1.80 g (P <0.05) and spleen index of 7.036±1.599 mg/10 g (P <0.05). The spleen indices in the hWRCP, mWRCP, and IWRCP group were all significantly higher than that in the 5-FU group (P <0.01 or P<0.05). No significant differences in body weight change were observed in WRCP groups compared with the control group P>0.05).	The treatment combination of WRCP and 5-FU was more effective in the inhibition of tumor growth than either agent alone and may have potentially additional benefit in improving the general condition and immunity of the mice with human breast cancer cell implants.	2012
22156302	Cancer cell metabolism.	Although the generation of a distinctive metabolic profile is a well-known aspect of cancer, the significance of these adaptations and their potential for exploitation for anticancer therapy has not been fully appreciated until recently. Many oncogenic changes known to affect intracellular signaling pathways play an active role in mediating these metabolic changes, which, in turn, function to support cancer cell growth and replication. In this chapter, we discuss the most current findings in cancer cell metabolism in terms of their impact on tumor cell growth as well as their potential for identifying new targets for therapeutic intervention.	2011
22115854	Physical distress and cancer care experiences among Chinese-American and non-Hispanic White breast cancer survivors.	The number of Chinese-American breast cancer survivors (BCS) is increasing as a result of increasing incidence rates. There has been little research on Chinese BCS' follow-up cancer care. This qualitative study aims to understand how Chinese-American BCS experience and cope with physical distress relative to non-Hispanic White (NHW) survivors.	Seventy-one BCS (37 Chinese immigrant, 7 US-born Chinese, 27 NHW) were recruited from the Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry to participate in focus group discussions or one-on-one interviews about their survivorship experiences. All BCS were diagnosed with breast cancer at stage 0-IIA between 2006 and 2009, and had survived for 1-4 years without recurrence. Interviews were conducted in Cantonese, Mandarin, or English. Data analyses followed established qualitative methods of content analysis.	BCS experienced pain and side effects from radiation, surgery, and hormonal therapy. Physical distress subsequently caused emotional concerns about recurrence or metastasis. Most BCS consulted physicians about their physical distress. Chinese immigrant BCS were less likely to have their issues resolved compared to NHW and US-born Chinese who were more likely to question physicians, ask for referrals, and make repeat attempts if their problems were not resolved. Some Chinese immigrant BCS turned to Traditional Chinese Medicine for relief or accepted the idea that physical distress was part of survivorship.	Chinese immigrant BCS may be at risk for greater distress compared with US-born Chinese and NHW BCS because of cultural norms that make them less inclined to express their needs to physicians or challenge physicians when their needs are not met. Furthermore, they may express symptoms in culturally unique ways (e.g., hot-cold imbalances). Further research is needed to determine how to best improve survivorship care experiences in this understudied population, with the goal of decreasing BCS' physical distress and improving quality of life.	2012
22112320	No difference in the frequency of locus-specific methylation in the peripheral blood DNA of women diagnosed with breast cancer and age-matched controls.	There is no doubt that aberrant somatic (tumor-specific) methylation significantly contributes to the carcinogenic process. However, the question of the relevance of methylation pattern changes, acquired by individuals during their development and lifetime or inherited through the germline, to the pathology of different diseases, remains open. Recently, a number of studies addressed the question of the prevalence of aberrant methylation of cancer-related genes in peripheral blood leukocyte (PBL) DNA and indicated a strong possibility that the presence of constitutional methylation of different genes might predispose for cancer development. Here, we have used the methlyation-sensitive high-resolution melting approach to examine the methylation status of the BRCA1, BRCA2, APC, RASSF1A and RARβ2 genes in PBLs of a group of women diagnosed with breast cancer, and an age-matched control group with no signs of breast cancer. No significant differences in the frequency of methylation of the above genes were found between cases and controls in our study. Hence, testing for the presence of methylation of cancer-related genes in PBL DNA from women diagnosed with sporadic breast cancer and classified for testing without any pathological or clinical selection criteria does not seem to have clinical applicability.	2011
22084374	Gemcitabine plus docetaxel versus docetaxel in patients with predominantly human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer: a randomized, phase III study by the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.	The objective of this phase III study was to compare the efficacy of gemcitabine plus docetaxel (GD) versus docetaxel in patients with advanced breast cancer.	Predominantly human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -negative patients were randomly assigned to gemcitabine (1,000 mg/m(2)) on days 1 and 8 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2)) on day 8 or to docetaxel (100 mg/m(2)) on day 1, every 21 days. Patients were untreated or had prior (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy or a single anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer. The primary end point was time to progression (TTP), and secondary end points were overall survival (OS), response rate (RR), and toxicity.	A total of 170 patients were allocated to GD, and 167 were allocated to docetaxel. Median TTP on GD was 10.3 months versus 8.3 months on docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59 to 1.01; log-rank P = .06). The adjusted Cox proportional model for TTP showed a significant difference favoring the combination (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.90; P = .007). However, RR was similar (GD, 36%; docetaxel, 34%), and OS was not different (P = .57). Grades 3 to 4 neutropenia was common (GD, 75%; docetaxel, 69%); infection was reported in 26% and 21% of patients in the GD and docetaxel groups, respectively. Grades 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia was more frequent with GD (GD, 16%; docetaxel, 0.6%), and peripheral neuropathy was higher with docetaxel (GD, 5%; docetaxel, 16%).	GD compared with docetaxel demonstrated increased TTP in metastatic breast cancer. However, RR and OS were similar. Thus, the addition of gemcitabine failed to demonstrate any clinically meaningful benefit when combined with docetaxel.	2011
22034635	Effects of tissue handling on RNA integrity and microarray measurements from resected breast cancers.	Reliable stability and yield of RNA from breast cancer tissues are important for biobanking, clinical trials, and diagnostic testing.	Aliquots of fresh primary tumor tissue from 17 surgically resected invasive breast cancers were placed into RNAlater at room temperature after tumor removal (baseline) and up to 3 hours thereafter or were snap frozen at baseline and 40 minutes thereafter. Samples were stored at -80°C until gene expression profiling with Affymetrix Human Gene U133A microarrays. We evaluated the effects of cold ischemic time (the time from tumor specimen removal to sample preservation) and sample preservation method on RNA yield, Bioanalyzer-based RNA integrity number, microarray-based 3'/5' expression ratios for assessing transcript integrity, and microarray-based measurement of single-gene and multigene expression signatures. The statistical significance of the effects was assessed using linear mixed effects regression models. All statistical tests were two-sided.	Sample preservation in RNAlater statistically significantly improved RNA integrity compared with snap freezing as assessed by the RNA integrity number, which increased from 7.31 to 8.13 units (difference = 0.82 units, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53 to 1.11 units, P < .001), and RNA yield, which increased threefold from 8.9 to 28.6 μg (difference = 19.7 μg, 95% CI = 14.1 to 25.3 μg, P < .001). Prolonged cold ischemic delay at room temperature before sample stabilization decreased the RNA integrity number by 0.12 units/h (95% CI = 0.02 to 0.23 units/h) compared with a projected average RNA integrity number of 7.39 if no delays were present (P = .008) and decreased the RNA yield by 1.5 μg/h (95% CI = 0 to 4 μg/h) from a baseline mean RNA yield of 33.5 μg if no delays were present (P = .019). Prolonged cold ischemia statistically significantly increased the 3'/5' ratio of control gene transcripts, particularly of STAT1 (P < .001). Snap freezing statistically significantly increased the 3'/5' ratio of three control transcripts (ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S rRNA). Expression levels of single genes and multigene signatures for breast cancer were largely unaffected by sample preservation method or cold ischemia.	Sample preservation in RNAlater improves RNA yield and quality, whereas cold ischemia increases RNA fragmentation as measured by the 3'/5' expression ratio of control genes. However, expression levels of single genes and multigene signatures that are of diagnostic relevance in breast cancer were mostly unaffected by sample preservation method or prolonged cold ischemic duration.	2011
22018631	Assessment of letrozole and tamoxifen alone and in sequence for postmenopausal women with steroid hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: the BIG 1-98 randomised clinical trial at 8·1 years median follow-up.	Postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer have persistent, long-term risk of breast-cancer recurrence and death. Therefore, trials assessing endocrine therapies for this patient population need extended follow-up. We present an update of efficacy outcomes in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 study at 8·1 years median follow-up.	BIG 1-98 is a randomised, phase 3, double-blind trial of postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer that compares 5 years of tamoxifen or letrozole monotherapy, or sequential treatment with 2 years of one of these drugs followed by 3 years of the other. Randomisation was done with permuted blocks, and stratified according to the two-arm or four-arm randomisation option, participating institution, and chemotherapy use. Patients, investigators, data managers, and medical reviewers were masked. The primary efficacy endpoint was disease-free survival (events were invasive breast cancer relapse, second primaries [contralateral breast and non-breast], or death without previous cancer event). Secondary endpoints were overall survival, distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), and breast cancer-free interval (BCFI). The monotherapy comparison included patients randomly assigned to tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years. In 2005, after a significant disease-free survival benefit was reported for letrozole as compared with tamoxifen, a protocol amendment facilitated the crossover to letrozole of patients who were still receiving tamoxifen alone; Cox models and Kaplan-Meier estimates with inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW) are used to account for selective crossover to letrozole of patients (n=619) in the tamoxifen arm. Comparison of sequential treatments to letrozole monotherapy included patients enrolled and randomly assigned to letrozole for 5 years, letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years, or tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years. Treatment has ended for all patients and detailed safety results for adverse events that occurred during the 5 years of treatment have been reported elsewhere. Follow-up is continuing for those enrolled in the four-arm option. BIG 1-98 is registered at clinicaltrials.govNCT00004205.	8010 patients were included in the trial, with a median follow-up of 8·1 years (range 0-12·4). 2459 were randomly assigned to monotherapy with tamoxifen for 5 years and 2463 to monotherapy with letrozole for 5 years. In the four-arm option of the trial, 1546 were randomly assigned to letrozole for 5 years, 1548 to tamoxifen for 5 years, 1540 to letrozole for 2 years followed by tamoxifen for 3 years, and 1548 to tamoxifen for 2 years followed by letrozole for 3 years. At a median follow-up of 8·7 years from randomisation (range 0-12·4), letrozole monotherapy was significantly better than tamoxifen, whether by IPCW or intention-to-treat analysis (IPCW disease-free survival HR 0·82 [95% CI 0·74-0·92], overall survival HR 0·79 [0·69-0·90], DRFI HR 0·79 [0·68-0·92], BCFI HR 0·80 [0·70-0·92]; intention-to-treat disease-free survival HR 0·86 [0·78-0·96], overall survival HR 0·87 [0·77-0·999], DRFI HR 0·86 [0·74-0·998], BCFI HR 0·86 [0·76-0·98]). At a median follow-up of 8·0 years from randomisation (range 0-11·2) for the comparison of the sequential groups with letrozole monotherapy, there were no statistically significant differences in any of the four endpoints for either sequence. 8-year intention-to-treat estimates (each with SE ≤1·1%) for letrozole monotherapy, letrozole followed by tamoxifen, and tamoxifen followed by letrozole were 78·6%, 77·8%, 77·3% for disease-free survival; 87·5%, 87·7%, 85·9% for overall survival; 89·9%, 88·7%, 88·1% for DRFI; and 86·1%, 85·3%, 84·3% for BCFI.	For postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer, a reduction in breast cancer recurrence and mortality is obtained by letrozole monotherapy when compared with tamoxifen montherapy. Sequential treatments involving tamoxifen and letrozole do not improve outcome compared with letrozole monotherapy, but might be useful strategies when considering an individual patient's risk of recurrence and treatment tolerability.

21984380	In vivo targeting of HER2-positive tumor using 2-helix affibody molecules.	Molecular imaging of human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) expression has drawn significant attention because of the unique role of the HER2 gene in diagnosis, therapy and prognosis of human breast cancer. In our previous research, a novel cyclic 2-helix small protein, MUT-DS, was discovered as an anti-HER2 Affibody analog with high affinity through rational protein design and engineering. MUT-DS was then evaluated for positron emission tomography (PET) of HER2-positive tumor by labeling with two radionuclides, 68Ga and 18F, with relatively short half-life (t1/2<2 h). In order to fully study the in vivo behavior of 2-helix small protein and demonstrate that it could be a robust platform for labeling with a variety of radionuclides for different applications, in this study, MUT-DS was further radiolabeled with 64Cu or 111In and evaluated for in vivo targeting of HER2-positive tumor in mice. Design 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) conjugated MUT-DS (DOTA-MUT-DS) was chemically synthesized using solid phase peptide synthesizer and I2 oxidation. DOTA-MUT-DS was then radiolabeled with 64Cu or 111In to prepare the HER2 imaging probe (64Cu/111In-DOTA-MUT-DS). Both biodistribution and microPET imaging of the probe were evaluated in nude mice bearing subcutaneous HER2-positive SKOV3 tumors. DOTA-MUT-DS could be successfully synthesized and radiolabeled with 64Cu or 111In. Biodistribution study showed that tumor uptake value of 64Cu or 111In-labeled DOTA-MUT-DS was 4.66±0.38 or 2.17±0.15%ID/g, respectively, in nude mice bearing SKOV3 xenografts (n=3) at 1 h post-injection (p.i.). Tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios for 64Cu-DOTA-MUT-DS were attained to be 3.05 and 3.48 at 1 h p.i., respectively, while for 111In-DOTA-MUT-DS, they were 2.04 and 3.19, respectively. Co-injection of the cold Affibody molecule ZHER2:342 with 64Cu-DOTA-MUT-DS specifically reduced the SKOV3 tumor uptake of the probe by 48%. 111In-DOTA-MUT-DS displayed lower liver uptake at all the time points investigated and higher tumor to blood ratios at 4 and 20 h p.i., when compared with 64Cu-DOTA-MUT-DS. This study demonstrates that the 2-helix protein based probes, 64Cu/111In DOTA-MUT-DS, are promising molecular probes for imaging HER2-positive tumor. Two-helix small protein scaffold holds great promise as a novel and robust platform for imaging and therapy applications.	2012
21969629	High-resolution multiphoton imaging of tumors in vivo.	Analysis of the individual steps in metastasis is crucial if insights at the molecular level are to be linked to the cell biology of cancer. A technical hurdle to achieving the analysis of the individual steps of metastasis is the fact that, at the gross level, tumors are heterogeneous in both animal models and patients. Human primary tumors show extensive variation in all properties ranging from growth and morphology of the tumor through tumor-cell density in the blood and formation and growth of metastases. Methods capable of the direct visualization and analysis of tumor-cell behavior at single-cell resolution in vivo have become crucial in advancing the understanding of mechanisms of metastasis, the definition of microenvironment, and the markers related to both. This article discusses the use of high-resolution multiphoton imaging of tumors (specifically breast tumors in mice) in vivo.	2011
21917992	Extracellular matrix degradation and remodeling in development and disease.	The extracellular matrix (ECM) serves diverse functions and is a major component of the cellular microenvironment. The ECM is a highly dynamic structure, constantly undergoing a remodeling process where ECM components are deposited, degraded, or otherwise modified. ECM dynamics are indispensible during restructuring of tissue architecture. ECM remodeling is an important mechanism whereby cell differentiation can be regulated, including processes such as the establishment and maintenance of stem cell niches, branching morphogenesis, angiogenesis, bone remodeling, and wound repair. In contrast, abnormal ECM dynamics lead to deregulated cell proliferation and invasion, failure of cell death, and loss of cell differentiation, resulting in congenital defects and pathological processes including tissue fibrosis and cancer. Understanding the mechanisms of ECM remodeling and its regulation, therefore, is essential for developing new therapeutic interventions for diseases and novel strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.	2011
21892704	The advantage of letrozole over tamoxifen in the BIG 1-98 trial is consistent in younger postmenopausal women and in those with chemotherapy-induced menopause.	Letrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, is ineffective in the presence of ovarian estrogen production. Two subpopulations of apparently postmenopausal women might derive reduced benefit from letrozole due to residual or returning ovarian activity: younger women (who have the potential for residual subclinical ovarian estrogen production), and those with chemotherapy-induced menopause who may experience return of ovarian function. In these situations tamoxifen may be preferable to an aromatase inhibitor. Among 4,922 patients allocated to the monotherapy arms (5 years of letrozole or tamoxifen) in the BIG 1-98 trial we identified two relevant subpopulations: patients with potential residual ovarian function, defined as having natural menopause, treated without adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and age ≤ 55 years (n = 641); and those with chemotherapy-induced menopause (n = 105). Neither of the subpopulations examined showed treatment effects differing from the trial population as a whole (interaction P values are 0.23 and 0.62, respectively). Indeed, both among the 641 patients aged ≤ 55 years with natural menopause and no chemotherapy (HR 0.77 [0.51, 1.16]) and among the 105 patients with chemotherapy-induced menopause (HR 0.51 [0.19, 1.39]), the disease-free survival (DFS) point estimate favoring letrozole was marginally more beneficial than in the trial as a whole (HR 0.84 [0.74, 0.95]). Contrary to our initial concern, DFS results for young postmenopausal patients who did not receive chemotherapy and patients with chemotherapy-induced menopause parallel the letrozole benefit seen in the BIG 1-98 population as a whole. These data support the use of letrozole even in such patients.	2012
21889924	Core-shell biodegradable nanoassemblies for the passive targeting of docetaxel: features, antiproliferative activity and in vivo toxicity.	Amphiphilic block copolymers of poly(ɛ-caprolactone) and poly(ethylene oxide) were assembled in core-shell nanoparticles (NPs) by a melting-sonication technique (MeSo). The entrapment of the poorly water-soluble anticancer drug docetaxel (DTX), nanocarrier cytotoxicity toward different cells and toxicity in mice were investigated. The encapsulation mechanism was rationalized and related to copolymer properties such as crystallinity and drug solubility in the copolymer phase. DTX release from NPs occurred in 2 drug pulses over 30 days. DTX entrapment in NPs strongly decreased haemolysis of erythrocytes in comparison with a commercial DTX formulation. In comparison with free DTX, NPs were both more efficient in inhibiting cell growth of breast and prostate cancer cells and less toxic in experimental animal models. The results of this study indicate that MeSo is an interesting technique for the achievement of peculiar core-shell nanocarriers for the passive targeting and sustained release of poorly water-soluble anticancer drugs.	In this study, stealth nanoparticles of PEO/PCL block copolymers for passive targeting of docetaxel to solid tumors were developed using a novel technique. The studied properties of NPs suggest strong potential as anticancer drug-delivery system.	2012
21835824	Quantification of cold spots caused by geometrical uncertainty in field-in-field techniques for whole breast radiotherapy.	To quantify the cold spot under geometrical uncertainties in field-in-field techniques for whole breast radiotherapy.	Ten consecutive patients from both the left- and right-sided treatment site groups who received whole breast radiotherapy with the field-in-field technique were included. Virtual plans were made with moving isocenters to the posterior direction having two amplitudes (5 and 10 mm) and prescribing the same monitor unit as the original plan (FIF_5 and FIF_10). The planning target volume for evaluation was defined by subtracting the areas within 5 mm from the skin and within 5 mm from the lung from the whole breast. The differences in V90, V95 and D98 of planning target volume for evaluation were measured between the original and virtual plans. As a reference, the same measurements were taken for the wedge techniques (Wedge_5 and Wedge_10).	The differences in V95 were -0.2% on FIF_5, -1.7% on FIF_10, -0.5% on Wedge_5 and -1.5% on Wedge_10. The differences in V90 were -0.02% on FIF_5, -0.3% on FIF_10, -0.05% on Wedge_5 and -0.1% on Wedge_10. The differences in D98 were 0 Gy on FIF_5, -0.1 Gy on FIF_10, -0.2 Gy on Wedge_5 and -0.4 Gy on Wedge_10. The differences in D98 between the original plans and virtual scenarios for field-in-field techniques were significantly smaller than those for wedge techniques, but there were no statically significant differences in V90 and V95.	The quantity of the cold spots caused by the geometrical uncertainties in field-in-field techniques was similar to that for the wedge techniques and was acceptable.	2011
21789554	Innate immune cells in breast cancer--from villains to heroes?	The innate immune system ensures effective protection against foreign pathogens and plays important roles in tissue remodeling. There are many types of innate immune cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and granulocytes. Interestingly, these cells accumulate in most solid tumors, including those of the breast. There, they play a tumor-promoting role through secretion of growth and angiogenic factors, as well as immunosuppressive molecules. This is in strong contrast to the tumor-suppressing effects that innate immune cells exert in vitro upon proper activation. Therapeutic approaches have been developed with the aim of achieving similar suppressive activities in vivo. However, multiple factors in the tumor microenvironment, many of which are immunosuppressive, represent a major obstacle to effective treatment. Here, we discuss the potential of combating breast cancer through activation of the innate immune system, including possible strategies to enhance the success of immunotherapy.	2011
21784705	Taxane-induced nail changes: Predictors and efficacy of the use of frozen gloves and socks in the prevention of nail toxicity.	The primary endpoint of this study was to determine predictors of taxane-related nail toxicity. The secondary endpoint was to evaluate the efficacy of the use of frozen gloves and socks in the prevention of taxane-related nail toxicity.	This descriptive, interventional, cross-sectional study was conducted with 200 patients. The patients were assigned to the frozen gloves/socks intervention group or control group. Frozen gloves/socks were applied only in hourly taxane-based treatments. The Patients Record Forms of the clinic were used in data collection. Nail changes were graded using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria for each patient and treatment. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the factors that affect nail changes.	The majority of the patients enrolled in the study were women diagnosed with breast cancer. The two groups were statistically similar for the cancer diagnosis, type and number of taxane cycles administered. Grade 1 nail toxicity was found in 34%, grade 2 in 11%, and grade 3 in 5.5% patients. Taxane-related nail toxicity was higher in patients who were female, had a history of diabetes, received capecitabine in conjunction with docetaxel and had breast or gynecological cancer diagnosis. Nail changes increased with an increase in the number of taxane cycles administered, BMI and severity of treatment-related neuropathy.	The multivariate analysis demonstrated that BMI, breast or ovarian cancer diagnosis and the number of taxane cycles administered were the independent factors for this toxicity. No statistically significant difference in nail toxicity incidence and time to occurrence of nail changes was found between the intervention and the control groups.	2012
21776773	Response-probability volume histograms and iso-probability of response charts in treatment plan evaluation.	This study aims at demonstrating a new method for treatment plan evaluation and comparison based on the radiobiological response of individual voxels. This is performed by applying them on three different cancer types and treatment plans of different conformalities. Furthermore, their usefulness is examined in conjunction with traditionally applied radiobiological and dosimetric treatment plan evaluation criteria.	Three different cancer types (head and neck, breast and prostate) were selected to quantify the benefits of the proposed treatment plan evaluation method. In each case, conventional conformal radiotherapy (CRT) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatment configurations were planned. Iso-probability of response charts was produced by calculating the response probability in every voxel using the linear-quadratic-Poisson model and the dose-response parameters of the corresponding structure to which this voxel belongs. The overall probabilities of target and normal tissue responses were calculated using the Poisson and the relative seriality models, respectively. The 3D dose distribution converted to a 2 Gy fractionation, D2(GY) and iso-BED distributions are also shown and compared with the proposed methodology. Response-probability volume histograms (RVH) were derived and compared with common dose volume histograms (DVH). The different dose distributions were also compared using the complication-free tumor control probability, P+, the biologically effective uniform dose, D, and common dosimetric criteria.	3D Iso-probability of response distributions is very useful for plan evaluation since their visual information focuses on the doses that are likely to have a larger clinical effect in that particular organ. The graphical display becomes independent of the prescription dose highlighting the local radiation therapy effect in each voxel without the loss of important spatial information. For example, due to the exponential nature of the Poisson distribution, cold spots in the target volumes or hot spots in the normal tissues are much easier to be identified. Response-volume histograms, as DVH, can also be derived and used for plan comparison. RVH are advantageous since by incorporating the radiobiological properties of each voxel they summarize the 3D distribution into 2D without the loss of relevant information. Thus, more clinically relevant radiobiological objectives and constraints could be defined and used in treatment planning optimization. These measures become increasingly important when dose distributions need to be designed according to the microscopic biological properties of tumor and normal tissues.	The proposed methods do not aim to replace quantifiers like the probabilities of total tissue response, which ultimately are the quantities of interest to evaluate treatment success. However, iso-probability of response charts and response-probability volume histograms illustrates more clearly the difference in effectiveness between different treatment plans than the information provided by alternative dosimetric data. The use of 3D iso-probability of response distributions could serve as a good descriptor of the effectiveness of a dose distribution indicating primarily the regions in a tissue that dominate its response.	2011
21732745	The challenge and importance of standardizing pre-analytical variables in surgical pathology specimens for clinical care and translational research.	The introduction of targeted cancer therapies into clinical practice, in which patients are selected for novel treatments based on results of companion molecular testing of their tumor specimens, has created significant new challenges for the surgical pathology laboratory. These include standardization of tissue handling and sample preparation with accurate documentation to ensure optimal quality of clinical samples to reduce the risk of errors in molecular biology tests. The assay of tumor tissues for biomarkers that can provide predictive data for prognosis or treatment should enable selection of the most appropriate therapies (Yaziji et al. 2008, Hicks and Kulkarni 2008). Major advances have been made in the ability to profile clinical samples for research at the DNA, RNA and protein levels. To translate this new information into the clinical setting, however, the quality of the starting material, in this case the tumor tissue, determines the accuracy and reliability of companion diagnostic assay results and therefore optimal therapeutic strategies. Inaccurate results owing to compromised tissue quality can lead to false positive or false negative results with therapeutic consequences that can harm patients and affect their eventual outcome.	2012
21704956	Effect of Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan on hot flashes in young patients: a retrospective case series.	Hot flashes are one of the main problems in postmenopausal patients. Hormone replacement therapy is the standard treatment for this vasomotor symptom, but long-term estrogen treatment can produce serious adverse effects such as higher risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. For this reason, hormone replacement therapy may not be advisable for young patients. Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan is an herbal decoction for hot flashes used in traditional Chinese medicine. We have extensive experience treating hot flashes in young women; this preliminary case series evaluates the effectiveness of Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan for alleviating hot flashes in young patients. In this retrospective case series, we reviewed the medical records of outpatients who visited the Department of Cardiovascular and Neurologic Disease, Kyung Hee Oriental Medical Center for hot flashes from October 1, 2003 to October 1, 2008. Of the 60 cases, 37 met the inclusion criteria. Mean improvement in symptoms, as assessed using the visual analog scale, was 40.4 ± 28.5%; 51.3% of patients experienced a 50% improvement. According to the secondary analysis, the results of differential diagnosis of cold and hot syndrome and blood stasis syndrome did not affect scores. Only 2.7% of the patients reported adverse events. Our findings suggest that Gui-zhi-fu-ling-wan improves hot flashes in young patients in a relatively safe manner. However, rigorous clinical studies are needed to confirm these results.	2011
21646376	Choosing a mouse model: experimental biology in context--the utility and limitations of mouse models of breast cancer.	Genetically engineered mice are critical experimental models for the study of breast cancer biology. Transgenic mice, employing strong mammary epithelial promoters to drive oncogenes, develop carcinomas with phenotypes corresponding to the molecular pathway activated. Gene-targeted (knockout) mice, in which tumor suppressors are deleted, develop mammary neoplasms with phenotypes primarily including patterns seen in spontaneous mouse mammary tumors, albeit at higher rates. Improved genetic engineering, using inducible gene expression, somatic gene transduction, conditional alleles, and crossbreeding for combined/compound genetic engineering yields precise molecular models with exquisite experimental control and phenotypes with comparative pathologic validity. Mammary gland transplantation technology adds a practical and validated method for assessing biologic behavior of selected mammary tissues. Overall, the many mouse models available are a rich resource for experimental biology with phenocopies of breast cancer subtypes, and a variety of practical advantages. The challenge is matching the model to the experimental question.	2011
21572364	PET imaging of EGFR expression in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-468, a human breast adenocarcinoma.	Cetuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR overexpression has been observed in a subset of breast cancers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate 64Cu-labeled cetuximab as an imaging agent using MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells.	Cetuximab was coupled with an N-sulfosuccinimide ester of DOTA, purified, and labeled with the positron-emitting nuclide, 64Cu. Receptor-binding specificity and affinity of 64Cu-DOTA-cetuximab were studied using human MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, which express high levels of EGFR. Micropositron emission tomography and biodistribution studies were performed in athymic nude mice bearing MDA-MB-468 cell xenografts. Blocking studies with cold cetuximab were also performed to determine the specific binding of cetuximab.	The radiochemical yield was 97.1 ± 1.1%. The specific activity was 1.5 Ci/μm cetuximab and the affinity to EGFR-positive MDA-MB-468 cells was high (KD=0.4 nmol/l). Both biodistribution and micropositron emission tomographic imaging studies with 64Cu-DOTA-cetuximab showed higher tumor uptake at 24 h (20.91 ± 2.49% ID/g, standardized uptake values of 9.6) than at 4 h (11.65 ± 3.89% ID/g, standardized uptake values of 4.9). Tumor uptake was significantly reduced from 20.91 ± 2.49% ID/g at 24 h to 14.42 ± 0.85% ID/g in a 1-h blocking study (P=0.00).	Cetuximab can be labeled with 64Cu without compromising its biological activity. The tumor uptake was excellent with high tumor/muscle (7.97 ± 1.78 at 4 h, 15.91 ± 6.04 at 24 h) and reasonable tumor/blood (0.5 ± 0.18 at 4 h, 2.12 ± 0.86 at 24 h) ratios. Blocking studies showed the specific binding of the labeled antibody to tumor tissue.	2011
21519325	Quantitative assessment shows loss of antigenic epitopes as a function of pre-analytic variables.	Pre-analytic variables, specifically cold ischemic time, have been implicated as key variables in the measurement of proteins by immunohistochemistry. To determine the significance and magnitude of antigenic loss due to pre-analytic variables, we have compared protein antigenicity in core needle biopsies, with essentially no cold ischemic time, with that in routinely processed tumor resection specimens. Two cohorts of matched core needle biopsies and tumor resections were collected with 20 matched pairs and 14 matched pairs, respectively. Both series were analyzed by quantitative immunofluorescence using the AQUA® method. Epitopes phospho-ERK, total ERK, phospho-AKT, total AKT, phospho-S6K1, total S6K1, estrogen receptor (ER), Ki67, cytokeratin and GAPDH were assessed. Detection levels for all phospho-epitopes were significantly decreased in tumor resections compared with biopsies while no significant change was seen in the corresponding total proteins. Of the other four proteins examined, ER and cytokeratin showed significant loss of antigenicity. This data suggest that measurement of phospho-protein antigenicity in formalin-fixed tissue by immunological methods is dramatically affected by pre-analytic variables. This study suggests that core needle biopsies are more accurate for assessment of tissue biomarkers.	2011
21399628	Tumour evolution inferred by single-cell sequencing.	Genomic analysis provides insights into the role of copy number variation in disease, but most methods are not designed to resolve mixed populations of cells. In tumours, where genetic heterogeneity is common, very important information may be lost that would be useful for reconstructing evolutionary history. Here we show that with flow-sorted nuclei, whole genome amplification and next generation sequencing we can accurately quantify genomic copy number within an individual nucleus. We apply single-nucleus sequencing to investigate tumour population structure and evolution in two human breast cancer cases. Analysis of 100 single cells from a polygenomic tumour revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that probably represent sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a monogenomic primary tumour and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumour and seeded the metastasis. In both primary tumours, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant subpopulation of genetically diverse 'pseudodiploid' cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to gradual models of tumour progression, our data indicate that tumours grow by punctuated clonal expansions with few persistent intermediates.	2011
21331621	Genetic variants in ultraconserved elements and risk of breast cancer in Chinese population.	Ultraconserved elements (UCEs) are the most extreme representatives of conserved non-coding sequences. Recent studies have indicated that UCEs are not mutation cold regions and likely to be concerned with cancers, including breast cancer (BC). In this study, we first screened common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (minor allele frequency, MAF > 0.05) in Chinese population located in 481 UCEs sequences and selected seven SNPs (rs17049105, rs13020355, rs2682406, rs2056116, rs11190870, rs9572903, and rs8004379) of uc.51, uc.82, uc.133, uc.140, uc.302, uc.353, and uc.368, respectively. A two-stage case-control study of BC with a total of 1,497 cases and 1,497 controls in Chinese population was conducted to test the hypothesis that these SNPs of UCEs are associated with BC risk. Stage I with 735 cases and 735 controls was designed to discover the risk variants, followed by stage II with 762 cases and 762 controls to validate the significant variants. In stage I, although the genotype distributions of all seven SNPs were not significantly different between BC cases and controls, logistic regression analyses revealed that the variant genotypes of rs8004379 were significantly associated with the increased risk of BC (dominant model: adjusted OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.01-1.58, P = 0.039). We then selected two SNPs, rs8004379 A/C and rs2056116 A/G, with lowest P values of the associations into the stage II analysis. However, none of above two SNPs were significantly associated with BC risk in both stage II and pooled set (rs8004379 AC/CC vs. AA: adjusted OR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.68-1.13 for stage II and adjusted OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.92-1.29 for the pooled set; rs2056116 AG/GG vs. AA: adjusted OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 0.87-1.45 for stage II and adjusted OR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.94-1.31 for the pooled set). These findings did not support a significant association between UCEs SNPs and the risk of BC in Chinese population.	2011
21326040	Nucleic acid quality preservation by an alcohol-based fixative: comparison with frozen tumors in a routine pathology setting.	Pathologic diagnosis requires tissue fixation for histologic and immunohistologic analysis, and formalin is routinely used for this. The disadvantage of this fixative is its inability to preserve nucleic acids. Pathologic tumor diagnosis requires extensive molecular analyses, for which formalin fixation may be not adequate. Recently, an alcohol-based fixative (molecular fixative, MF) was described that allows nucleic acid preservation as well as histologic and immunohistologic studies. Moreover, the MF fixation processing system (Xpress) is fast and is well adapted to a routine process. We evaluated RNA and DNA quality within 1 month and after 1 year for 10 breast carcinomas and 20 sarcomas fixed in MF in comparison with the corresponding frozen tumors. The quality of DNA extracted from the MF-fixed tissue was similar to that extracted from the frozen tumors. The quality of RNA extracted from the MF-fixed tissue was lower than that of frozen tumors; nevertheless, a majority of RNA integrity number (RIN) values were greater than 7. Gene expression quantification by real-time polymerase chain reaction gave comparable results between tumors fixed with MF and frozen tumors. Tissue fixation at 4°C with the MF improved the RNA quality measured by the RIN value. However, after storage for 1 year at room temperature, although DNA quality was preserved, RNA extracted from tissues fixed with the MF was degraded. Tissue fixation with the MF is an important improvement for molecular pathologic diagnosis, enabling a combination of routine pathologic diagnoses and current molecular diagnoses if they are carried out near the processing time.	2011
21289045	Structure and function of the perinucleolar compartment in cancer cells.	The perinucleolar compartment (PNC) is a subnuclear body that forms in cancer cells. In vivo analyses using human tumor tissues demonstrate a close correlation between PNC prevalence and disease progress in colorectal carcinoma, and a high PNC prevalence is associated with poor patient outcome. These findings are consistent with previous observations in breast cancer and cancer cell lines in vitro. The PNC is composed of thick strands that form a filamental meshwork often extending into the nucleolus. Although it appears to be electron dense as observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), the actual density of the structure imaged by electron spectroscopy is much lower, similar to that of the interchromatin space, and is lined with ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). In situ detections show that the PNC is highly enriched with a subset of small RNAs of polymerase III (Pol III) origins and RNA-binding proteins primarily implicated in pre-mRNA processing. A novel gel-shifting approach demonstrates that the addition of PNC-associated RNAs into HeLa cell lysates increases the mobility of polypyrimidine tract-binding (PTB) protein in a native gel electrophoresis, suggesting an interaction between these RNAs and PTB proteins. On the basis of these and other findings, we propose a working model in which novel RNPs have a key role in regulating gene expression at the PNC in cancer cells.	2010

21195878	Treatment of HER2-expressing breast cancer and ovarian cancer cells with alpha particle-emitting 227Th-trastuzumab.	To evaluate the cytotoxic effects of low-dose-rate alpha particle-emitting radioimmunoconjugate (227)Th-p-isothiocyanato-benzyl-DOTA-trastuzumab ((227)Th-trastuzumab [where DOTA is 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid]) internalized by breast and ovarian cancer cell lines in order to assess the potential of (227)Th-trastuzumab as a therapeutic agent against metastatic cancers that overexpress the HER2 oncogene.	Clonogenic survival and cell growth rates of breast cancer cells treated with (227)Th-trastuzumab were compared with rates of cells treated with nonbinding (227)Th-rituximab, cold trastuzumab, and X-radiation. Cell growth experiments were also performed with ovarian cancer cells. Cell-associated radioactivity was measured at several time points, and the mean radiation dose to cells was calculated.	SKBR-3 cells got 50% of the mean absorbed radiation dose from internalized activity and 50% from cell surface-bound activity, while BT-474 and SKOV-3 cells got 75% radiation dose from internalized activity and 25% from cell surface-bound activity. Incubation of breast cancer cells with 2.5 kBq/ml (227)Th-trastuzumab for 1 h at 4°C, followed by washing, resulted in mean absorbed radiation doses of 2 to 2.5 Gy. A dose-dependent inhibition of cell growth and an increase in apoptosis were induced in all cell lines.	Clinically relevant activity concentrations of (227)Th-trastuzumab induced a specific cytotoxic effect in three HER2-expressing cell lines. The cytotoxic effect of (227)Th-trastuzumab was higher than that of single-dose X-radiation (relative biological effectiveness = 1.2). These results warrant further studies of treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer with (227)Th-trastuzumab.	2011
21176180	Pre-analytic variables and phospho-specific antibodies: the Achilles heel of immunohistochemistry.	Immunohistochemistry is the most common method for companion diagnostic testing in breast cancer. The readings for estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and Her2 directly affect prescription of critical therapies. However, immunohistochemistry is highly sensitive to innumerable pre-analytic variables that result in loss of signal in these assays. Perhaps the most significant pre-analytic variable is cold ischemic time. The work of Pinhel and colleagues in the previous issue of Breast Cancer Research examines the effects of cold ischemic time and finds a chilling result. The authors show that while the classic markers may be only mildly affected, phospho-specific markers are highly sensitive to this artifact. As a result, it is likely that future companion diagnostic tests that include phospho-specific epitopes will be reliably done only in core needle biopsies that minimize ischemic time.	2010
21170760	Enhanced oncolysis mediated by Coxsackievirus A21 in combination with doxorubicin hydrochloride.	Virotherapy is an emerging strategy for the treatment of cancer that utilizes both replication-competent and genetically modified viruses to selectively kill tumor cells. We have previously shown that Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21), a common-cold producing enterovirus, is an effective oncolytic agent against human melanoma, prostate, and breast cancer xenografts in vivo. CVA21 specifically targets and lytically infects susceptible cells expressing the CVA21 cellular receptors, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Herein, the efficacy of CVA21 administered in combination with doxorubicin hydrochloride as a new therapeutic regimen for cancer was investigated. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the human breast, colorectal, and pancreatic cancer cell lines examined expressed moderate levels of surface ICAM-1 and DAF, whilst a normal breast cell line expressed only minimal levels. When CVA21 was combined with doxorubicin hydrochloride, synergistically enhanced cell death was observed when CVA21 was administered both simultaneously or 24 h prior to doxorubicin hydrochloride exposure. Doxorubicin hydrochloride had no effect on CVA21 replication. Through the use of an orthotopic (MDA-MB-231-luc) xenograft SCID mouse model of human breast cancer we showed that a single intravenous injection of CVA21 in combination with an intraperitoneal injection of doxorubicin hydrochloride resulted in significantly greater tumor reduction compared to either agent alone. Overall, these findings highlight the exciting potential of CVA21, administered in combination with doxorubicin hydrochloride, as a new therapeutic regimen for cancer.	2012
21149948	Modeling static and dynamic thermography of the human breast under elastic deformation.	An abnormal thermogram has been shown to be a reliable indicator of increased risk of breast cancer. Numerical modeling techniques for thermography are proposed to quantify the complex relationships between the breast thermal behaviors and the underlying physiological/pathological conditions. Previous thermal modeling techniques did not account for gravity-induced elastic deformation arising from various body postures, nor did they suggest that a dynamic thermal procedure may be used to enhance clinical diagnosis. In this paper, 3D finite element method (FEM)-based thermal and elastic modeling techniques are developed to characterize comprehensively both the thermal and elastic properties of normal and tumorous breast tissues during static and dynamic thermography. In the steady state, gravity-induced breast deformation is found to cause an upper-lower asymmetric surface temperature contrast for sitting/standing up body posture, even though all the thermal and elastic properties are assumed uniform. Additionally, the tumor-induced surface temperature alterations are found to be caused primarily by shallow tumors and to be less sensitive to tumor size than to tumor depth. In the dynamic state, the breast exhibits distinctive temporal patterns that are associated with distinct thermal events: cold stress and thermal recovery induced by changes in the ambient temperature. Specifically, the tumor-induced thermal contrast shows an opposite initial change and delayed peak as compared with the deformation-induced thermal contrast. These findings are expected to provide a stronger foundation for, and greater specificity and precision in, thermographic diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer.	2011
21123394	Leukocytes in mammary development and cancer.	Leukocytes, of both the innate and adaptive lineages, are normal cellular components of all tissues. These important cells not only are critical for regulating normal tissue homeostasis, but also are significant paracrine regulators of all physiologic and pathologic tissue repair processes. This article summarizes recent insights regarding the trophic roles of leukocytes at each stage of mammary gland development and during cancer development, with a focus on Murids and humans.	2011
21121082	Sensation Following Immediate Breast Reconstruction with Implants.	Sensation is a neglected aspect of the outcome of breast reconstructions with implants. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the cutaneous somatosensory status in breasts following mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with permanent adjustable prostheses and to analyze the patients' subjective experience of the sensation. Twenty-four consecutive patients diagnosed with invasive or in situ breast carcinoma were examined preoperatively and 2 years after mastectomy and reconstruction, for assessment of perception thresholds for touch, cold, warmth, and heat pain above and below the areola. Von Frey filaments and a Peltier element-based thermode were used. The patients completed a questionnaire concerning their experienced sensation in the reconstructed breast. Using quantitative somato-sensory testing, the sensation to all the examined modalities was significantly impaired compared to preoperatively. Most affected was the area above the areola. Patients given postoperative radiotherapy (n = 9) did not differ from those without radiotherapy (n = 15) regarding any of the modalities. All patients reported reduced sensation in the reconstructed breast compared to that preoperatively. Twenty-three patients stated that the reconstructed breast felt different from the other breast; nevertheless 16 reported that the reconstructed breast felt like a real breast. The study revealed sensation impairment following mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with implants. Patients should be informed about this effect preoperatively to allow adequate expectations regarding the sensation outcome. However, two-thirds of the study patients considered that the reconstructed breast felt like a real breast, which must be one of the main purposes of a breast reconstruction.
21115856	Effect of obesity on prognosis after early-stage breast cancer.	This study was performed to characterize the impact of obesity on the risk of breast cancer recurrence and death as a result of breast cancer or other causes in relation to adjuvant treatment.	Information on body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis was available for 18,967 (35%) of 53,816 women treated for early-stage breast cancer in Denmark between 1977 and 2006 with complete follow-up for first events (locoregional recurrences and distant metastases) up to 10 years and for death up to 30 years. Information was available on prognostic factors and adjuvant treatment for all patients. Univariate analyses were used to compare the associations of known prognostic factors and risks of recurrence or death according to BMI categories. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the influence of BMI after adjusting for other factors.	Patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or more were older and had more advanced disease at diagnosis compared with patients with a BMI below 25 kg/m(2) (P < .001). When data were adjusted for disease characteristics, the risk of developing distant metastases after 10 years was significantly increased by 46%, and the risk of dying as a result of breast cancer after 30 years was significantly increased by 38% for patients with a BMI of 30 kg/m(2) or more. BMI had no influence on the risk of locoregional recurrences. Both chemotherapy and endocrine therapy seemed to be less effective after 10 or more years for patients with BMIs greater than 30 kg/m(2).	Obesity is an independent prognostic factor for developing distant metastases and for death as a result of breast cancer; the effects of adjuvant therapy seem to be lost more rapidly in patients with breast cancer and obesity.	2011
24899965	Normal Physiologic and Benign Foci with F-18 FDG Avidity on PET/CT in Patients with Breast Cancer.	The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiologic and benign F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avid foci in patients with breast cancer.	On 309 F-18 FDG PET/CT scans of 241 women with breast cancer, the hypermetabolic lesions compared with the surrounding normal region were evaluated retrospectively. Available reports of other relevant radiological imaging, medical records, and follow-up PET/CT were reviewed for explanations of the abnormal uptake.	Among the 70 physiologic foci, muscular uptake of the lower neck following the surgical and/or radiation therapy of ipsilateral breast (29%), hypermetabolic ovaries (16%) and uterine (10%) uptake during the ovulatory and menstrual phases during the normal menstrual cycle were identified, and also hypermetabolic brown fat in cold-induced thermogenesis (7%), non-specific bowel uptake (35%) were observed. Among the 147 benign lesions, sequelae of the chest wall and breasts following surgical and/or radiation therapy, were often observed (27%). Hypermetabolic thyroid glands were noted as adenomas and chronic thyroiditis (18%). Reactive hyperplasia of cervical or mediastinal lymph nodes (32%), degenerative osteoarthritis and healed fractures (15%), hypermetabolic benign lung lesions (6%) were observed.	Altered physiologic and benign F-18 FDG uptake in the lower cervical muscle and chest wall following ipsilateral breast surgery or radiotherapy were common, and also normal physiologic uptake in ovary and uterus, brown fat, thyroid were considered as predominant findings in women patients with breast cancer. Knowledge of these findings might aid in the interpretation of FDG PET/CT in patients with breast cancer.	2010
21047916	Systems biology and genomics of breast cancer.	It is now accepted that breast cancer is not a single disease, but instead it is composed of a spectrum of tumor subtypes with distinct cellular origins, somatic changes, and etiologies. Gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays has contributed significantly to our understanding of the molecular heterogeneity of breast tumor formation, progression, and recurrence. For example, at least two clinical diagnostic assays exist (i.e., OncotypeDX RS and Mammaprint®) that are able to predict outcome in patients using patterns of gene expression and predetermined mathematical algorithms. In addition, a new molecular taxonomy based upon the inherent, or "intrinsic," biology of breast tumors has been developed; this taxonomy is called the "intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer," which now identifies five distinct tumor types and a normal breast-like group. Importantly, the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer predict patient relapse, overall survival, and response to endocrine and chemotherapy regimens. Thus, most of the clinical behavior of a breast tumor is already written in its subtype profile. Here, we describe the discovery and basic biology of the intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer, and detail how this interacts with underlying genetic alternations, response to therapy, and the metastatic process.	2011
20980442	Mammary gland ECM remodeling, stiffness, and mechanosignaling in normal development and tumor progression.	Cells of the mammary gland are in intimate contact with other cells and with the extracellular matrix (ECM), both of which provide not only a biochemical context, but a mechanical context as well. Cell-mediated contraction allows cells to sense the stiffness of their microenvironment, and respond with appropriate mechanosignaling events that regulate gene expression and differentiation. ECM composition and organization are tightly regulated throughout development of the mammary gland, resulting in corresponding regulation of the mechanical environment and proper tissue architecture. Mechanical regulation is also at play during breast carcinoma progression, as changes in ECM deposition, composition, and organization accompany breast carcinoma. These changes result in stiffer matrices that activate mechanosignaling pathways and thereby induce cell proliferation, facilitate local tumor cell invasion, and promote progression. Thus, understanding the role of forces in the mammary gland is crucial to understanding both normal developmental and pathological processes.	2011
20961975	A compendium of the mouse mammary tumor biologist: from the initial observations in the house mouse to the development of genetically engineered mice.	For over a century, mouse mammary tumor biology and the associated mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) have served as the foundation for experimental cancer research, in general, and, in particular, experimental breast cancer research. Spontaneous mouse mammary tumors were the basis for studies of the natural history of neoplasia, oncogenic viruses, host responses, endocrinology and neoplastic progression. However, lacking formal proof of a human mammary tumor virus, the preeminence of the mouse model faded in the 1980s. Since the late 1980s, genetically engineered mice (GEM) have proven extremely useful for studying breast cancer and have become the animal model for human breast cancer. Hundreds of mouse models of human breast cancer have been developed since the first demonstration in 1984. The GEM have attracted a new generation of molecular and cellular biologists eager to apply their skill sets to these surrogates of the human disease. Newcomers often enter the field without an appreciation of the origins of mouse mammary tumor biology and the basis for many of the prevailing concepts. Our purpose in writing this compendium is to extend an "olive branch" while simultaneously deepen the knowledge of the novice mouse mammary tumor biologist as they journey into a field rich in pathology and genetics spanning several centuries.	2011
20932258	The emerging pharmacology of TRPM8 channels: hidden therapeutic potential underneath a cold surface.	Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) is a non-selective cation channel activated by cold temperature and cooling agents. TRPM8 is expressed in a subpopulation of cold-sensitive sensory neurons, as well as in the male urogenital system. TRPM8 is markedly upregulated in prostate cancer and in other tumors such as breast adenocarcinoma and melanoma. Moreover, recent studies suggest the potential involvement of TRPM8 channels in the pathophysiology of cold nociception and cold allodynia. This has led to a strong interest in the pursuit of novel modulators of TRPM8 channels. This review highlights our current knowledge of TRPM8 pharmacology and modulation mechanisms, detailing structural features important for TRPM8 gating by different agonists, the mechanism of antagonism by different compounds and the potential relevance of TRPM8 for treatment of various pathological conditions.	2011
20878849	Sleep aid use during and following breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.	Knowledge of sleep aid use is limited despite the high prevalence of insomnia among women before, during, and following breast cancer adjuvant chemotherapy treatments (CTX). This study's purpose was to (1) determine the frequency and characteristics of participants taking sleep aid(s); (2) identify the frequency and percentage of sleep aid use by category (prescription sedative/hypnotics, prescription anti-depressants, prescription analgesics, prescription anti-emetics, over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics, OTC cold/flu/sinus, OTC sleep, alcohol, and herbal supplements); and (3) compare sleep aid use by category in the experimental and control groups within a randomized-controlled clinical trial (RCT).	Longitudinal, descriptive, secondary RCT data analysis of women (n=219) receiving out-patient CTX, and at 30, 60, and 90 days following the last CTX and 1 year following CTX1. Participants recorded daily sleep aid use on a Sleep Diary. Analyses included descriptives, chi-square, and RM-ANOVA.	Approximately 20% of participants took at least one sleep aid before CTX1; usage decreased over time (12-18%); a second sleep aid was used infrequently. Prescription sedative/hypnotics (46%) and OTC analgesics (24%) were used most frequently. OTC sleep aids were most commonly used as a second aid. Prescription sedative/hypnotics [F(7,211)=4.26, p=0.00] and OTC analgesics [F(7,211)=2.38, p=0.023] use decreased significantly over time.	Results reflect the natural course of CTX, recovery, and healing. Comprehensive screening for sleep-wake disturbances and sleep aid use may lead to a better understanding of the risks and benefits of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic interventions, and ultimately lead to selection of the safest and most effective treatment.	2011

20849261	Feeling too hot or cold after breast cancer: is it just a nuisance or a potentially important prognostic factor?	There is widespread recognition among both patients and caregivers that breast cancer patients often experience debilitating deficiencies in their ability to achieve thermal comfort, feeling excessively hot or cold under circumstances when others are comfortable. However, this symptom receives little clinical or scientific attention beyond identification and testing of drugs that minimise menopausal-like symptoms. Could some of these symptoms represent an important prognostic signal? Could thermal discomfort be among other cytokine-driven sickness behaviour symptoms seen in many breast cancer patients? While the literature reveals a strong link between treatment for breast cancer and some menopausal vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flashes also known as "hot flushes"), there is little data on quantitative assessment of severity of different types of symptoms and their possible prognostic potential. However, recent, intriguing studies indicating a correlation between the presence of hot flashes and reduced development of breast cancer recurrence strongly suggests that more study on this topic is needed. In comparison to reports on the phenomenon of breast cancer-associated hot flashes, there is essentially no scientific study on the large number of women who report feeling excessively cold after breast cancer treatment. Since similar acquired thermal discomfort symptoms can occur in patients with cancers other than breast cancer, there may be as yet unidentified cancer- or treatment-driven factor related to temperature dysregulation. In general, there is surprisingly little information on the physiological relationship between body temperature regulation, vasomotor symptoms, and cancer growth and progression. The goal of this article is twofold: (1) to review the scientific literature regarding acquired deficits in thermoregulation among breast cancer survivors and (2) to propose some speculative ideas regarding the possible basis for thermal discomfort among some of these women. Specifically, we suggest a potential association with excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine activity, similar to other cytokine-driven symptoms experienced after breast cancer, including fatigue and depression. We highlight the similarity of some breast cancer-associated thermal discomfort symptoms to those which occur during fever, suggesting the possibility that there may be common underlying changes in pro-inflammatory cytokine activity in both conditions. We anticipate that this contribution will stimulate additional scientific interest among researchers in identifying potential mechanisms and prognostic significance of this under-studied aspect of breast cancer biology and survivorship.	2010
20810549	TGF-beta biology in mammary development and breast cancer.	Transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) was first implicated in mammary epithelial development by Daniel and Silberstein in 1987 and in breast cancer cells and hormone resistance by Lippman and colleagues in 1988. TGF-β is critically important for mammary morphogenesis and secretory function through specific regulation of epithelial proliferation, apoptosis, and extracellular matrix. Differential TGF-β effects on distinct cell types are compounded by regulation at multiple levels and the influence of context on cellular responses. Studies using controlled expression and conditional-deletion mouse models underscore the complexity of TGF-β biology across the cycle of mammary development and differentiation. Early loss of TGF-β growth regulation in breast cancer evolves into fundamental deregulation that mediates cell interactions and phenotypes driving invasive disease. Two outstanding issues are to understand the mechanisms of biological control in situ and the circumstances by which TGF-β regulation is subverted in neoplastic progression.	2011
20739412	Hormone action in the mammary gland.	A woman's breast cancer risk is affected by her reproductive history. The hormonal milieu also influences the course of the disease. The female reproductive hormones, estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, have a major impact on breast cancer and control postnatal mammary gland development. Analysis of hormone receptor mutant mouse strains combined with tissue recombination techniques and proteomics revealed that sequential activation of hormone signaling in the mammary epithelium is required for progression of morphogenesis. Hormones impinge on a subset of luminal mammary epithelial cells (MECs) that express hormone receptors and act as sensor cells translating and amplifying systemic signals into local stimuli. Proliferation is induced by paracrine mechanisms mediated by distinct factors at different stages. Tissue and stage specificity of hormonal signaling is achieved at the molecular level by different chromatin contexts and differential recruitment of coactivators and corepressors.	2010
20719876	Oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.	Breast cancer progression involves multiple genetic events, which can activate dominant-acting oncogenes and disrupt the function of specific tumor suppressor genes. This article describes several key oncogene and tumor suppressor signaling networks that have been implicated in breast cancer progression. Among the tumor suppressors, the article emphasizes BRCA1/2 and p53 tumor suppressors. In addition to these well characterized tumor suppressors, the article highlights the importance of PTEN tumor suppressor in counteracting PI3K signaling from activated oncogenes such as ErbB2. This article discusses the use of mouse models of human breast that recapitulate the key genetic events involved in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. Finally, the therapeutic potential of targeting these key tumor suppressor and oncogene signaling networks is discussed.	2010
20702598	Cell-matrix interactions in mammary gland development and breast cancer.	The mammary gland is an organ that at once gives life to the young, but at the same time poses one of the greatest threats to the mother. Understanding how the tissue develops and functions is of pressing importance in determining how its control mechanisms break down in breast cancer. Here we argue that the interactions between mammary epithelial cells and their extracellular matrix (ECM) are crucial in the development and function of the tissue. Current strategies for treating breast cancer take advantage of our knowledge of the endocrine regulation of breast development, and the emerging role of stromal-epithelial interactions (Fig. 1). Focusing, in addition, on the microenvironmental influences that arise from cell-matrix interactions will open new opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We suggest that ultimately a three-pronged approach targeting endocrine, growth factor, and cell-matrix interactions will provide the best chance of curing the disease.	2010
20651254	Immunoliposomal delivery of 213Bi for alpha-emitter targeting of metastatic breast cancer.	Current treatment for late-stage metastatic breast cancer is largely palliative. alpha-Particles are highly potent, short-range radiation emissions capable of sterilizing individual cells with one to three traversals of the cell nucleus. The alpha-emitter, (213)Bi (T(1/2) = 45.6 min), was conjugated to a 100-nm diameter liposomal-CHX-A''-DTPA construct, upon which the rat HER2/neu reactive antibody, 7.16.4, was grafted. A conjugation time of 10 minutes was achieved giving a specific activity corresponding to 0.1 (213)Bi atom per liposome; stability in vitro and in vivo was confirmed. Efficacy in a rat/neu transgenic mouse model of metastatic mammary carcinoma was investigated. Three days after left cardiac ventricular injection of 10(5) rat HER-2/neu-expressing syngeneic tumor cells, macrophage-depleted Neu-N mice were treated by i.v. injection with (a) 19.2 MBq (520 muCi) of liposome-CHX-A''-DTPA-(213)Bi, (b) 19.2 MBq of liposome-CHX-A''-DTPA-(213)Bi-7.16.4, (c) 4.44 MBq (120 muCi) of (213)Bi-7.16.4, and (d) cold (nonradioactive) liposome-CHX-A''-DTPA-7.16.4 as control. Treatment with (a) increased median survival time to 34 days compared with 29 days for the untreated controls (P = 0.013) and 27 days for treated cold controls. Treatment with the radiolabeled antibody-conjugated liposome (b) increased median survival time to 38 days (P = 0.0002 relative to untreated controls). The radiolabeled antibody-treated group (c) gave a median survival of 39 days, which was similar to that for the radiolabeled antibody-conjugated liposome-treated group (P = 0.5). We have shown that the (213)Bi radiolabeled immunoliposomes are effective in treating early-stage micrometastases, giving median survival times similar to those obtained with antibody-mediated delivery of (213)Bi in this animal model.	2010
20610549	Chromatin remodeling in mammary gland differentiation and breast tumorigenesis.	DNA methylation and histone modifications have essential roles in remodeling chromatin structure of genes necessary for multi-lineage differentiation of mammary stem/progenitor cells. The role of this well-defined epigenetic programming is to heritably maintain transcriptional plasticity of these loci over multiple cell divisions in the differentiated progeny. Epigenetic events can be deregulated in progenitor cells chronically exposed to xenoestrogen or inflammatory microenvironment. In addition, epigenetically mediated silencing of genes associated with tumor suppression can take place, resulting in clonal proliferation of undifferentiated or semidifferentiated cells. Alternatively, microRNAs that negatively regulate the expression of their protein-coding targets may become epigenetically repressed, leading to oncogenic expression of these genes. Here we further discuss interactions between DNA methylation and histone modifications that have significant contributions to the differentiation of mammary stem/progenitor cells and to tumor initiation and progression.	2010
20607601	Three-dimensional collagen represses cyclin E1 via β1 integrin in invasive breast cancer cells.	The behavior of breast epithelial cells is influenced by their microenvironment which includes stromal cells and extracellular matrix (ECM). During cancer progression, the tissue microenvironment fails to control proliferation and differentiation, resulting in uncontrolled growth and invasion. Upon invasion, the ECM encountered by breast cancer cells changes from primarily laminin and collagen IV to primarily collagen I. We show here that culturing invasive breast cancer cells in 3-dimensional (3D) collagen I inhibits proliferation through direct regulation of cyclin E1, a G(1)/S regulator that is overexpressed in breast cancer. When the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was cultured within 3D collagen I gels, the G(1)/S transition was inhibited as compared to cells cultured on conventional 2D collagen or plastic dishes. Cells in 3D collagen downregulated cyclin E1 protein and mRNA, with no change in cyclin D1 level. Cyclin D1 was primarily cytoplasmic in 3D cultures, and this was accompanied by decreased phosphorylation of Rb, a nuclear target for both cyclin E1- and cyclin D1-associated kinases. Positive regulators of cyclin E1 expression, the transcription factor c-Myc and cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRP), were decreased in 3D collagen cultures, while the collagen I receptor β1 integrin was greatly increased. Inhibition of β1 integrin function rescued proliferation and cyclin E1 expression as well as c-Myc expression and Rb phosphorylation, but cyclin D1 remained cytoplasmic. We conclude that cyclin E1 is repressed independent of effects on cyclin D1 in a 3D collagen environment and dependent on β1 integrin interaction with collagen I, reducing proliferation of invasive breast cancer cells.	2011
20599698	YB-1 alters MT1-MMP trafficking and stimulates MCF-7 breast tumor invasion and metastasis.	YB-1 is a member of the cold shock domain family, with complex roles in DNA structure, gene transcription and translation. YB-1 promotes chromosomal instability, and mammary gland transgenic expression induces tumors with 100% penetrance. YB-1 is linked to poor prognosis in breast carcinoma and is a strong predictor of relapse and disease-specific survival. Survival is directly tied to the extent of local invasion and distal metastasis, processes dependent upon the activity of the membrane type I-matrix metalloproteinase, MT1-MMP. Non-invasive MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells were transfected with YB-1/EGFP. YB-1 protein was detected in the invadopodia of cells with a migratory phenotype. There was increased expression of MT1-MMP protein concentrated at the leading edges of motile cells, which were highly invasive in collagen three-dimensional culture. The rates of MT1-MMP protein endocytosis and recycling to the cell surface were elevated in clones expressing higher levels of YB-1 protein. Control MCF-7 cells formed nonfatal, non-invasive, differentiated adenocarcinomas in vivo. MCF-7 cells expressing a twofold increase in YB-1 formed highly anaplastic tumors with local invasion, pulmonary metastases and high lethality. We conclude that YB-1 contributes to the development of an invasive, metastatic breast carcinoma phenotype by enhanced presentation of MT1-MMP at the sites of cellular invasion.	2010
20596676	Y-box binding protein 1 is up-regulated in proliferative breast cancer and its inhibition deregulates the cell cycle.	The Y-box-binding protein 1 (YB-1), a member of the cold-shock domain RNA-and DNA-binding protein family, has pleiotropic functions such as regulation of the cell cycle. The aim of this study was to evaluate if YB-1 is a proliferative marker in breast cancer and elucidate potential downstream targets involved in YB-1-mediated cell cycle regulation using RNA interference technology. YB-1 protein expression was evaluated in tissue microarrays of 131 breast invasive ductal carcinomas by immunohistochemistry, while the YB-1 gene expression profile was evaluated in the T-47D, MDA-MB-231, ZR-75-1 and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. Silencing of the YB-1 gene in T-47D breast cancer cells was performed using siRNA and the effects of down-regulation of YB-1 on cell growth and regulation of the cell cycle were ascertained. A focused panel of 84 genes involved in cell cycle progression was also examined. In tissue microarrays, YB-1 expression was shown to be associated with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining. siRNA-mediated silencing of the YB-1 gene inhibited cell proliferation and induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest in T-47D breast cancer cells. Knockdown of the YB-1 gene induced up-regulation of two genes which contribute to G1-arrest (RAD9A and CDKN3 genes) and down-regulation of ten genes associated with positive regulation of the cell cycle (SKP2, SUMO1, ANAPC4, CCNB1, CKS2, MNAT1, CDC20, RBBP8, KPNA2 and CCNC genes). The data obtained from the tissue microarrays and cell lines provide evidence that YB-1 is a reliable marker of cell proliferation and possibly a potential molecular target in breast cancer therapy.	2010
20592421	Genomic architecture characterizes tumor progression paths and fate in breast cancer patients.	Distinct molecular subtypes of breast carcinomas have been identified, but translation into clinical use has been limited. We have developed two platform-independent algorithms to explore genomic architectural distortion using array comparative genomic hybridization data to measure (i) whole-arm gains and losses [whole-arm aberration index (WAAI)] and (ii) complex rearrangements [complex arm aberration index (CAAI)]. By applying CAAI and WAAI to data from 595 breast cancer patients, we were able to separate the cases into eight subgroups with different distributions of genomic distortion. Within each subgroup data from expression analyses, sequencing and ploidy indicated that progression occurs along separate paths into more complex genotypes. Histological grade had prognostic impact only in the luminal-related groups, whereas the complexity identified by CAAI had an overall independent prognostic power. This study emphasizes the relation among structural genomic alterations, molecular subtype, and clinical behavior and shows that objective score of genomic complexity (CAAI) is an independent prognostic marker in breast cancer.	2010
20591988	The role of the microenvironment in mammary gland development and cancer.	The mammary gland is composed of a diverse array of cell types that form intricate interaction networks essential for its normal development and physiologic function. Abnormalities in these interactions play an important role throughout different stages of tumorigenesis. Branching ducts and alveoli are lined by an inner layer of secretory luminal epithelial cells that produce milk during lactation and are surrounded by contractile myoepithelial cells and basement membrane. The surrounding stroma comprised of extracellular matrix and various cell types including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and infiltrating leukocytes not only provides a scaffold for the organ, but also regulates mammary epithelial cell function via paracrine, physical, and hormonal interactions. With rare exceptions breast tumors initiate in the epithelial compartment and in their initial phases are confined to the ducts but this barrier brakes down with invasive progression because of a combination of signals emitted by tumor epithelial and various stromal cells. In this article, we overview the importance of cellular interactions and microenvironmental signals in mammary gland development and cancer.	2010
20554705	Mammary gland growth factors: roles in normal development and in cancer.	Normal development of the mammary gland proceeds via interactions between the epithelium and the mesenchyme that start during embryogenesis and continue during pubertal outgrowth and differentiation. The function of specific peptide growth factors that bind members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family and the cytokine receptor family are required at each stage. In many cases the peptides are produced in one compartment and act on receptors in the other compartment. One of the striking differences between normal development and cancer is the loss of this cross-talk. Mammary tumor cells often produce a peptide and express the receptor on the same cell leading to autocrine activation of signaling pathways, a mechanism that is characteristic for cancer cells. We will discuss different peptides in the context of normal development and cancer in this review.	2010
20544273	Identification of immunodominant HLA-B7-restricted CD8+ cytotoxic T cell epitopes derived from mammaglobin-A expressed on human breast cancers.	Mammaglobin-A (MGBA), a 10-kD protein, is over expressed in 80% of primary and metastatic human breast cancers. Breast cancer patients demonstrate high frequencies of CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific to MGBA. Defining CD8(+) CTL responses to HLA class I-restricted MGBA-derived epitopes assumes significance in the context of our ongoing efforts to clinically translate vaccine strategies targeting MGBA for prevention and/or treatment of human breast cancers. In this study, we define the CD8(+) CTL response to MGBA-derived candidate epitopes presented in the context of HLA-B7, which has a frequency of 17.7% in Caucasian and 15.5% in African American populations. We identified seven MGBA-derived candidate epitopes with high predicted binding scores for HLA-B7 using a computer algorithm. Membrane stabilization studies with TAP-deficient T2 cells transfected with HLA-B7 indicated that MGBA B7.3 (VSKTEYKEL), B7.6 (KLLMVLMLA), B7.7 (NPQVSKTEY), and B7.1 (YAGSGCPLL) have the highest HLA-B7 binding affinities. Further, two CD8(+) CTL cell lines generated in vitro against T2.B7 cells individually loaded with MGBA-derived candidate epitopes showed significant cytotoxic activity against MGBA B7.1, B7.3, B7.6, and B7.7. In addition, the same CD8(+) CTL lines lysed the HLA-B7(+)/MGBA(+) human breast cancer cell line DU-4475 but had no significant cytotoxicity against HLA-B7(-) or MGBA(-) breast cancer cell lines. Cold-target inhibition studies strongly suggest that MGBA B7.3 is an immunodominant epitope. In summary, our results define HLA-B7-restriced, MGBA-derived, CD8(+) CTL epitopes with all of the necessary features for developing novel vaccine strategies against HLA-B7 expressing breast cancer patients.	2011
20537601	Tracing the tumor lineage.	Defining the pathways through which tumors progress is critical to our understanding and treatment of cancer. We do not routinely sample patients at multiple time points during the progression of their disease, and thus our research is limited to inferring progression a posteriori from the examination of a single tumor sample. Despite this limitation, inferring progression is possible because the tumor genome contains a natural history of the mutations that occur during the formation of the tumor mass. There are two approaches to reconstructing a lineage of progression: (1) inter-tumor comparisons, and (2) intra-tumor comparisons. The inter-tumor approach consists of taking single samples from large collections of tumors and comparing the complexity of the genomes to identify early and late mutations. The intra-tumor approach involves taking multiple samples from individual heterogeneous tumors to compare divergent clones and reconstruct a phylogenetic lineage. Here we discuss how these approaches can be used to interpret the current models for tumor progression. We also compare data from primary and metastatic copy number profiles to shed light on the final steps of breast cancer progression. Finally, we discuss how recent technical advances in single cell genomics will herald a new era in understanding the fundamental basis of tumor heterogeneity and progression.	2010
20519343	Using functional genetics to understand breast cancer biology.	Genetic screens were for long the prerogative of those that studied model organisms. The discovery in 2001 that gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) can also be brought about in mammalian cells paved the way for large scale loss-of-function genetic screens in higher organisms. In this article, we describe how functional genetic studies can help us understand the biology of breast cancer, how it can be used to identify novel targets for breast cancer therapy, and how it can help in the identification of those patients that are most likely to respond to a given therapy.	2010
20484386	Molecular mechanisms guiding embryonic mammary gland development.	The mammary gland is an epidermal appendage that begins to form during embryogenesis, but whose development is only completed during pregnancy. Each mammary gland begins as a budlike invagination of the surface ectoderm, which then gives rise to a simple duct system by birth. Subsequent development occurs during sexual maturation and during pregnancy and lactation. In this review, we outline the distinct stages of embryonic mammary development and discuss the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of morphogenesis at each stage. We also discuss the potential relevance of embryonic breast development to the pathophysiology of breast cancer and highlight questions for future research.	2010
20452965	Stem cells in the human breast.	The origins of the epithelial cells participating in the development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer of the human breast are poorly understood. However, emerging evidence suggests a role for adult tissue-specific stem cells in these processes. In a hierarchical manner, these generate the two main mammary cell lineages, producing an increasing number of cells with distinct properties. Understanding the biological characteristics of human breast stem cells and their progeny is crucial in attempts to compare the features of normal stem cells and cancer precursor cells and distinguish these from nonprecursor cells and cells from the bulk of a tumor. A historical overview of research on human breast stem cells in primary tissue and in culture reveals the progress that has been made in this area, whereas a focus on the cell-of-origin and reprogramming that occurs during neoplastic conversion provides insight into the enigmatic way in which human breast cancers are skewed toward the luminal epithelial lineage.	2010
20448377	Estrogen and progesterone hormone receptor status in breast carcinoma: comparison of immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry.	Estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) play a significant role in the prognosis of breast cancer. For preoperative chemotherapy in locally advanced lesions, trucut biopsy is used to localize the ER and PR receptors by immunohistochemistry. Immunocytochemistry can be a better alternative to immunohistochemistry as it better fixes cells.	To evaluate the degree of correlation between immunocytochemical (ICC) and immunohistochemical (IHC) determination of ER and PR in breast cancer.	Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was performed on 100 primary breast cancers immunostained for ER and PR during a period of 1 year 7 months, i.e., from January 2006 to July 2007.	Papanicolaou-stained slides were destained, fixed in cold acetone and submitted for immunocytochemistry. In the prospective analysis, FNAC smears were straightaway fixed in cold acetone and submitted for ER and PR. Peroxidase, antiperoxidase technique was used for immunocytochemistry.	Spearman Rank correlation test was used.	Differences between groups were analysed and correlations were studied. Concordance for ER was 50% and for PR was 29%. Both ER and PR were positive in four cases: ER only in three and PR in one, and both were negative in nine cases. Use of the least best buffer and technical errors contributed to the lower ICC rate.	Although Immunocytochemistry removes the derogatory step of antigen deterioration, technical errors can cause hindrance in achieving the best of the results.
20224159	Observer detection limits for a dedicated SPECT breast imaging system.	An observer-based contrast-detail study is performed in an effort to evaluate the limits of object detectability using a dedicated CZT-based breast SPECT imaging system under various imaging conditions. A custom geometric contrast-resolution phantom was developed that can be used for both positive ('hot') and negative contrasts ('cold'). The 3 cm long fillable tubes are arranged in six sectors having equal inner diameters ranging from 1 mm to 6 mm with plastic wall thicknesses of <0.25 mm, on a pitch of twice their inner diameters. Scans of the activity filled tubes using simple circular trajectories are obtained in a 215 mL uniform water filled cylinder, varying the rod:background concentration ratios from 10:1 to 1:10 simulating a large range of biological uptake ratios. The rod phantom is then placed inside a non-uniformly shaped 500 mL breast phantom and scans are again acquired using both simple and complex 3D trajectories for similarly varying contrasts. Summed slice and contiguous multi-slice images are evaluated by five independent readers, identifying the smallest distinguishable rod for each concentration and experimental setup. Linear and quadratic regression is used to compare the resulting contrast-detail curves. Results indicate that in a moderately low-noise 500 mL background, using the SPECT camera having 2.5 mm intrinsic pixels, the mean detectable rod was approximately 3.4 mm at a 10:1 ratio, degrading to approximately 5.2 mm with the 2.5:1 concentration ratio. The smallest object detail was observed using a 45 degrees tilted trajectory acquisition. The complex 3D projected sine wave acquisition, however, had the most consistent combined intra- and inter-observer results, making it potentially the best imaging approach for consistent results.	2010
20207342	Thyroid metastases from clear cell renal carcinoma 18 years after nephrectomy.	Single or multiple thyroid metastases from extra-thyroid primary tumors are reported to be rare. Malignancies that metastasize to the thyroid include cancers originating from lung, breast and kidney. We report our experience with a case of thyroid metastases, which were detected 18 years after curative kidney surgery for renal cell carcinoma. After 18 years, the patients noted the sudden appearance of a lump in the neck. Ultrasonography showed the presence of a multinodular goiter, all nodules being "cold" at scintiscan. Total thyroidectomy was performed; histology of all nodules revealed a metastatic thyroid cancer from renal cell carcinoma. The patient was still alive and in good health 16 months after thyroidectomy. History of patients with thyroid nodules should include inquiring about extra-thyroid malignancies, especially renal cell carcinoma, that may have been diagnosed even many years earlier. As a corollary, follow-up of such patients should include periodic thyroid exploration or at least a physical examination.	2010

20107248	An elastically compressible phantom material with mechanical and x-ray attenuation properties equivalent to breast tissue.	We have developed a novel phantom material: a solution of polyvinyl alcohol (PVAL) in ethanol and water, freeze-thawed to produce a solid yet elastically compressible gel. The x-ray attenuation and mechanical properties of these gels are compared with published measurements of breast tissue. Gels with PVAL concentrations from 5 to 20% w/v were produced. The linear x-ray attenuation coefficients of these gels range from 0.76 to 0.86 cm(-1) at 17.5 keV, increasing with PVAL concentration. These values are very similar to the published values of breast tissue at this energy, 0.8-0.9 cm(-1). Under compression cancerous breast tissue is approximately ten times stiffer than healthy breast tissue. The Young's moduli of the gels increase with PVAL concentration. Varying the PVAL concentration from 7.5 to 20% w/v produces gels with Young's moduli from 20 to 220 kPa at 15% strain. These values are characteristic of normal and cancerous breast tissue, respectively.	2010
20092350	Development of mass spectrometry-based shotgun method for proteome analysis of 500 to 5000 cancer cells.	A shotgun proteome analysis method and its performance for protein identification from 500 to 5000 cells are described. Sample preparation, which was done in one tube, involved the use of a surfactant (NP-40) for cell lysis, followed by acetone precipitation of the proteins. The resulting protein pellet was washed with cold acetone to remove remaining surfactant, and the pellet was then solubilized in NH(4)HCO(3). After trypsin digestion of the proteins, the digest was analyzed by the use of nanoflow liquid chromatography (LC) quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QTOF MS). Sample injection and gradient speed in running LC QTOF MS were optimized. It was shown that this method could identify an average (n = 3) of 167 +/- 21, 237 +/- 30, 491 +/- 63, and 619 +/- 59 proteins from 500, 1000, 2500, and 5000 MCF-7 breast cancer cells, respectively. To demonstrate the potential use of this method for generating proteome profile from circulating tumor cells (CTCs) isolated from human blood, a healthy human blood sample was spiked with MCF-7 cells, and this mixture was processed and then subjected to antibody tagging of the MCF-7 cells. The tagged cells were sorted and collected using flow cytometry. The proteome profiles of small numbers of cells isolated in this way were found to be similar to those of the original MCF-7 cells, suggesting the possibility of the use of this method for cell typing of CTCs.	2010
21612046	[Vitamin D3 in prevention of diseases in adults--a systematic review].	Current evidence indicates that vitamin D3 plays significant role in calcium balance and bone metabolism through lifetime. There are also evidence on preventive efficacy of vitamin D3 in diabetes, insulin-resistance, hypertension and malignancy.	The aim of the systematic review was to gather evidence regarding vitamin D3 in prevention of diseases in adults. MEDLINE via Pubmed was searched using key words: "vitamin D3, "prevention", "adults", "cardiovascular diseases", cancer", "osteoporosis", "common cold", "cold", "diabetes", "obesity", "depression". 26 trials were included into analysis: 17 randomized clinical trials, five observational studies, two systematic reviews, and two metaanalysis.	Vitamin D3 appears to has beneficial effect in depression therapy, protective effect on beta-cells in diabetic patients and reducing frequency of adverse events such as thrombosis in patients with prostate cancer. Supplementing with vitamin D3 results with no significant improve in reducing body weight, fat, blood pressure, risk of hypertension, level of lipids in serum, response to treatment in cancer prostate (together with dexamethasone and carboplatin). Many studies highlights beneficial influence of vitamin D3 with calcium on bone mineral density in whole body. Another studies show improve in bone mineral density in hips and pelvic bones only. There were inconsistencies of studies results regarding role of vitamin D3 in prevention of diabetes, risk of breast cancer and influence on bone mineral density.	Despite all inconsistencies supplementation of vitamin D3 is important and plays role in effective osteoporotic management and there is evidence on preventive efficacy of vitamin D3 in different diseases.	2010
19996280	Antimitotic effect of the retinoid 4-oxo-fenretinide through inhibition of tubulin polymerization: a novel mechanism of retinoid growth-inhibitory activity.	The retinoid 4-oxo-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4-oxo-4-HPR), a metabolite of fenretinide (4-HPR) present in plasma of 4-HPR-treated patients, is very effective in inducing growth inhibition and apoptosis in several cancer cell lines. 4-Oxo-4-HPR and 4-HPR have different mechanisms of action because 4-oxo-4-HPR, unlike 4-HPR, causes marked cell accumulation in G2-M phase. Here, we investigated the molecular events involving 4-oxo-4-HPR-induced cell cycle perturbation in ovarian (A2780 and IGROV-1) and breast (T47D, estrogen receptor+ and BT-20, estrogen receptor-) cancer cells. 4-Oxo-4-HPR induced a delay of mitosis (with mitotic index increasing 5- to 6-fold in all cell lines) without progression beyond the anaphase, as shown by cyclin B1 expression. 4-Oxo-4-HPR induced multipolar spindle formation and phosphorylation of BUBR1, resulting in activation of the spindle checkpoint. Multipolar spindles were not due to impairment of pole-focusing process, loss of centrosome integrity, or modulation of the expression levels of molecules associated with spindle aberrations (Kif 1C, Kif 2A, Eg5, Tara, tankyrase-1, centractin, and TOGp). We show here that 4-oxo-4-HPR targets microtubules because, in treated cells, it interfered with the reassembly of cold-depolymerized spindle microtubules and decreased the polymerized tubulin fraction. In cell-free assays, 4-oxo-4-HPR inhibited tubulin polymerization (50% inhibition of microtubule assembly at 5.9 micromol/L), suggesting a direct molecular interaction with tubulin. In conclusion, by showing that 4-oxo-4-HPR causes mitotic arrest through antimicrotubule activities, we delineate a new molecular mechanism for a retinoid.	2009
19964211	Effects of freezing on intratumoral drug transport.	Efficacy of many novel therapeutic agents are impaired by hindered interstitial diffusion in tumor. In the context of overcoming this drug delivery barrier, a hypothesis was postulated that freeze/thaw (F/T) may induce favorable changes of tumor tissue microstructure to facilitate the interstitial diffusion. This hypothesis may also be relevant to develop a mechanistically derived chemotherapeutic strategy for cryo-treated tumors. In the present study, this hypothesis was tested by characterizing the effects of F/T on the interstitial diffusion using an in vitro engineered tumor model (ET). The diffusion coefficients of FITC-labeled dextran was measured within the frozen/thawed and unfrozen ETs. The results showed that the diffusion coefficients increased after F/T but the extent of increase was dependent on the size of dextran. This implies that the combination of cryosurgery and chemotherapy should be designed considering the biophysical changes of tissues after freeze/thaw and the diffusion characteristics of drug molecules.	2009
19943129	Radiofrequency ablation of breast cancer: a comparative study of two needle designs.	Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is an emerging minimally invasive technique for breast cancer treatment. There are two different needle designs. One is to deploy a series of arrays to allow an even distribution of heat within the tumor. A new design is a straight needle with continuous infusion of cold saline to prevent charring and ensure continuous heat delivery. We report the first comparative study using two different needles for ablation of breast cancer.	Chinese patients with breast cancer less than 2 cm were prospectively recruited. Multifocal tumor was excluded. RFA was performed under general anesthesia following sentinel node biopsy. Sequential allocation was used. In the first group, tumor was ablated by using the LeVeen needle. Cool-tip needle was used in the subsequent group. The tumor was then resected. Tumor viability was assessed by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-diaphorase (NADH) staining. Complete ablation rate was compared. Evidence of thermal damage to the skin was also assessed.	Twenty patients were recruited. Mean tumor size was 14 mm. Complete ablation rate was the same (90% versus 89% for the Cool-tip and the LeVeen, respectively). Cool-tip has a shorter ablation time when compared with LeVeen (12 versus 28 min), and the Cool-tip needle was found to be easier to insert. There was no visible skin burn after RFA.	Cool-tip and LeVeen systems had the same efficacy in ablation of breast cancer, but Cool-tip was easier to insert and had a shorter ablation time.	2011
19930682	Nuclear detection of Y-box protein-1 (YB-1) closely associates with progesterone receptor negativity and is a strong adverse survival factor in human breast cancer.	Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) is the prototypic member of the cold shock protein family that fulfills numerous cellular functions. In the nucleus YB-1 protein orchestrates transcription of proliferation-related genes, whereas in the cytoplasm it associates with mRNA and directs translation. In human tumor entities, such as breast, lung and prostate cancer, cellular YB-1 expression indicates poor clinical outcome, suggesting that YB-1 is an attractive marker to predict patients' prognosis and, potentially, is suitable to individualize treatment protocols. Given these predictive qualities of YB-1 detection we sought to establish a highly specific monoclonal antibody (Mab) for diagnostic testing and its characterization towards outcome prediction (relapse-free and overall survival).	Hybridoma cell generation was carried out with recombinant YB-1 protein as immunogen and Mab characterization was performed using immunoblotting and ELISA with recombinant and tagged YB-1 proteins, as well as immunohistochemistry of healthy and breast cancer specimens. Breast tumor tissue array staining results were analyzed for correlations with receptor expression and outcome parameters.	YB-1-specific Mab F-E2G5 associates with conformational binding epitopes mapping to two domains within the N-terminal half of the protein and detects nuclear YB-1 protein by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues. Prognostic evaluation of Mab F-E2G5 was performed by immunohistochemistry of a human breast cancer tissue microarray comprising 179 invasive breast cancers, 8 ductal carcinoma in situ and 37 normal breast tissue samples. Nuclear YB-1 detection in human breast cancer cells was associated with poor overall survival (p = 0.0046). We observed a close correlation between nuclear YB-1 detection and absence of progesterone receptor expression (p = 0.002), indicating that nuclear YB-1 detection marks a specific subgroup of breast cancer. Likely due to limitation of sample size Cox regression models failed to demonstrate significance for nuclear YB-1 detection as independent prognostic marker.	Monoclonal YB-1 antibody F-E2G5 should be of great value for prospective studies to validate YB-1 as a novel biomarker suitable to optimize breast cancer treatment.	2009
19930681	Impact of biospecimens handling on biomarker research in breast cancer.	Gene expression profiling is moving from the research setting to the practical clinical use. Gene signatures able to correctly identify high risk breast cancer patients as well as to predict response to treatment are currently under intense investigation. While technical issues dealing with RNA preparation, choice of array platforms, statistical analytical tools are taken into account, the tissue collection process is seldom considered. The time elapsed between surgical tissue removal and freezing of samples for biological characterizations is rarely well defined and/or recorded even for recently stored samples, despite the publications of standard operating procedures for biological sample collection for tissue banks.	Breast cancer samples from 11 patients were collected immediately after surgical removal and subdivided into aliquots. One was immediately frozen and the others were maintained at room temperature for respectively 2, 6 and 24 hrs. RNA was extracted and gene expression profile was determined using cDNA arrays. Phosphoprotein profiles were studied in parallel.	Delayed freezing affected the RNA quality only in 3 samples, which were not subjected to gene profiling. In the 8 breast cancer cases with apparently intact RNA also in sample aliquots frozen at delayed times, 461 genes were modulated simply as a function of freezing timing. Some of these genes were included in gene signatures biologically and clinically relevant for breast cancer. Delayed freezing also affected detection of phosphoproteins, whose pattern may be crucial for clinical decision on target-directed drugs.	Time elapsed between surgery and freezing of samples appears to have a strong impact and should be considered as a mandatory variable to control for clinical implications of inadequate tissue handling.	2009
19903760	Inferring tumor progression from genomic heterogeneity.	Cancer progression in humans is difficult to infer because we do not routinely sample patients at multiple stages of their disease. However, heterogeneous breast tumors provide a unique opportunity to study human tumor progression because they still contain evidence of early and intermediate subpopulations in the form of the phylogenetic relationships. We have developed a method we call Sector-Ploidy-Profiling (SPP) to study the clonal composition of breast tumors. SPP involves macro-dissecting tumors, flow-sorting genomic subpopulations by DNA content, and profiling genomes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). Breast carcinomas display two classes of genomic structural variation: (1) monogenomic and (2) polygenomic. Monogenomic tumors appear to contain a single major clonal subpopulation with a highly stable chromosome structure. Polygenomic tumors contain multiple clonal tumor subpopulations, which may occupy the same sectors, or separate anatomic locations. In polygenomic tumors, we show that heterogeneity can be ascribed to a few clonal subpopulations, rather than a series of gradual intermediates. By comparing multiple subpopulations from different anatomic locations, we have inferred pathways of cancer progression and the organization of tumor growth.	2010
19865514	Antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of Centella asiatica (L) Urb.	In the present study, the phenolic (Folin-Dennis) and flavonoid (colorimetric assay) constituents, antioxidant [2,2-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl hydrate (DPPH) assay] and cytotoxic activities of an aqueous extract (AE) of Centella asiatica leaves were investigated. The aqueous extract (50 g/L) was obtained by infusion followed by cold maceration for 24 h. The levels of phenolic and flavonoid compounds were 2.86 g/100 g and 0.361 g/100 g, respectively. The AE showed elevated DPPH scavenging activity, with an IC(50) value of 31.25 microg/mL. The AE had a promising activity against mouse melanoma (B(16)F(1)), human breast cancer (MDA MB-231) and rat glioma (C(6)) cell lines, with IC(50) values of 698.0, 648.0 and 1000.0 microg/mL, respectively. A positive correlation was established between the level of flavonoids, antioxidant and antitumor activities.	2009
19833119	Experimental cryosurgery investigations in vivo.	Cryosurgery is the use of freezing temperatures to elicit an ablative response in a targeted tissue. This review provides a global overview of experimentation in vivo which has been the basis of advancement of this widely applied therapeutic option. The cellular and tissue-related events that underlie the mechanisms of destruction, including direct cell injury (cryolysis), vascular stasis, apoptosis and necrosis, are described and are related to the optimal methods of technique of freezing to achieve efficacious therapy. In vivo experiments with major organs, including wound healing, the putative immunological response following thawing, and the use of cryoadjunctive strategies to enhance cancer cell sensitivity to freezing, are described.	2009
19826412	Shc is required for ErbB2-induced inhibition of apoptosis but is dispensable for cell proliferation and disruption of cell polarity.	Amplification and overexpression of ErbB2 strongly correlates with aggressive breast cancers. A deeper understanding of pathways downstream of ErbB2 signaling that are required for the transformation of human mammary epithelial cells will identify novel strategies for therapeutic intervention in breast cancer. Using an inducible activation of ErbB2 autophosphorylation qsite mutants and the MCF-10A three-dimensional (3D) culture system, we investigated pathways used by ErbB2 to transform the epithelia. We report that ErbB2 induces cell proliferation and loss of 3D organization by redundant mechanisms, whereas it disrupts apical basal polarity and inhibits apoptosis using Tyr 1201 and Tyr 1226/7, respectively. Signals downstream of Tyr 1226/7 were also sufficient to confer paclitaxel resistance. The Tyr 1226/7 binds Shc, and the knockdown of Shc blocks the ability of ErbB2 to inhibit apoptosis and mediate paclitaxel resistance. Tyr 1226/7 is known to activate the Ras/Erk pathway; however, paclitaxel resistance did not correlate with the activation of Erk or Akt, suggesting the presence of a novel mechanism. Thus, our results show that targeting pathways used by ErbB2 to inhibit cell death is a better option than targeting cell proliferation pathways. Furthermore, we identify a novel function for Shc as a regulator of apoptosis and drug resistance in human mammary epithelial cells transformed by ErbB2.	2010
19825000	Interstitial laser therapy of breast fibroadenomas with 6 and 8 year follow-up.	Fibroadenomas are non-cancerous breast tumors commonly seen in teenagers but also found in women at the time of first mammogram. They have distinct physical findings and imaging features but the definitive diagnosis is made by ultrasound or stereotactic guided needle biopsy. Treatment options are observation or surgical removal. Recently, removal by ultrasound-guided technique has been reported. Alternatively, the tumor may be ablated within the breast by cold (cryotherapy) or by heat (laser, radiofrequency, focused ultrasound and microwave). In this paper the laser treatment in two patients, one with bilateral fibroadenomas, with 6 and 8 year follow-up is presented.
19777567	Cold-inducible RNA-binding protein contributes to human antigen R and cyclin E1 deregulation in breast cancer.	The cell cycle regulator cyclin E1 is aberrantly expressed in a variety of human cancers. In breast cancer, elevated cyclin E1 correlates with poor outcome, as do high cytoplasmic levels of the stress-induced RNA-binding protein human antigen R (HuR). We showed previously that increased cytoplasmic HuR elevates cyclin E1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by stabilizing its mRNA. We show here that cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRP) co-regulates cyclin E1 with HuR in breast cancer cells. CIRP had been shown to interact with HuR in Xenopus laevis oocytes and to be decreased in endometrial cancer. To investigate if human CIRP and HuR co-regulate cyclin E1, HuR and CIRP levels were altered in MCF-7 cells and effects on cyclin E1 assessed. Altering HuR expression resulted in a reciprocal change in CIRP expression, while altering CIRP expression resulted in corresponding changes in HuR and cyclin E1 expression. CIRP and HuR co-precipitated in the presence of RNA and CIRP enhanced HuR binding to the cyclin E1 mRNA and increased cyclin E1 mRNA stability. CIRP co-localized with HuR predominantly in the nucleus, but also in discrete cytoplasmic foci identified as stress granules (SGs). CIRP overexpression increased the number of HuR-containing SGs, while its knockdown decreased them. Our results suggest that CIRP positively regulates HuR, ultimately resulting in increased protein synthesis of at least one of its targets.	2010
19710015	The metastasis efficiency modifier ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B (RRP1B) is a chromatin-associated factor.	There is accumulating evidence for a role of germ line variation in breast cancer metastasis. We have recently identified a novel metastasis susceptibility gene, Rrp1b (ribosomal RNA processing 1 homolog B). Overexpression of Rrp1b in a mouse mammary tumor cell line induces a gene expression signature that predicts survival in breast cancer. Here we extend the analysis of RRP1B function by demonstrating that the Rrp1b activation gene expression signature accurately predicted the outcome in three of four publicly available breast carcinoma gene expression data sets. In addition, we provide insights into the mechanism of RRP1B. Tandem affinity purification demonstrated that RRP1B physically interacts with many nucleosome binding factors, including histone H1X, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, TRIM28 (tripartite motif-containing 28), and CSDA (cold shock domain protein A). Co-immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation confirmed these interactions and also interactions with heterochromatin protein-1alpha and acetyl-histone H4 lysine 5. Finally, we investigated the effects of ectopic expression of an RRP1B allelic variant previously associated with improved survival in breast cancer. Gene expression analyses demonstrate that, compared with ectopic expression of wild type RRP1B in HeLa cells, the variant RRP1B differentially modulates various transcription factors controlled by TRIM28 and CSDA. These data suggest that RRP1B, a tumor progression and metastasis susceptibility candidate gene, is potentially a dynamic modulator of transcription and chromatin structure.	2009
19692688	Letrozole therapy alone or in sequence with tamoxifen in women with breast cancer.	The aromatase inhibitor letrozole, as compared with tamoxifen, improves disease-free survival among postmenopausal women with receptor-positive early breast cancer. It is unknown whether sequential treatment with tamoxifen and letrozole is superior to letrozole therapy alone.	In this randomized, phase 3, double-blind trial of the treatment of hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, we randomly assigned women to receive 5 years of tamoxifen monotherapy, 5 years of letrozole monotherapy, or 2 years of treatment with one agent followed by 3 years of treatment with the other. We compared the sequential treatments with letrozole monotherapy among 6182 women and also report a protocol-specified updated analysis of letrozole versus tamoxifen monotherapy in 4922 women.	At a median follow-up of 71 months after randomization, disease-free survival was not significantly improved with either sequential treatment as compared with letrozole alone (hazard ratio for tamoxifen followed by letrozole, 1.05; 99% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 1.32; hazard ratio for letrozole followed by tamoxifen, 0.96; 99% CI, 0.76 to 1.21). There were more early relapses among women who were assigned to tamoxifen followed by letrozole than among those who were assigned to letrozole alone. The updated analysis of monotherapy showed that there was a nonsignificant difference in overall survival between women assigned to treatment with letrozole and those assigned to treatment with tamoxifen (hazard ratio for letrozole, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.02; P=0.08). The rate of adverse events was as expected on the basis of previous reports of letrozole and tamoxifen therapy.	Among postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer, sequential treatment with letrozole and tamoxifen, as compared with letrozole monotherapy, did not improve disease-free survival. The difference in overall survival with letrozole monotherapy and tamoxifen monotherapy was not statistically significant. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00004205.)	2009
19672259	Tamoxifen: the drug that came in from the cold.	Despite the perception of many oncologists that tamoxifen is an inferior drug, and should be substituted by an aromatase inhibitor in post-menopausal women, the current evidence strongly supports the view that AIs should be used 2-3 years after tamoxifen to achieve the maximal overall survival (OS) advantage.	2009
19653096	Association between tumor tissue TIMP-1 levels and objective response to first-line chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer.	In a previous study from our laboratory, high tumor levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) have been associated with an adverse response to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer suggesting that TIMP-1, which is known to inhibit apoptosis, may be a new predictive marker in this disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between TIMP-1 and objective response to chemotherapy in an independent patient population consisting of patients with metastatic breast cancer from Sweden and Denmark. TIMP-1 was measured using ELISA in 162 primary tumor extracts from patients who later developed metastatic breast cancer and these levels were related to the objective response to first-line chemotherapy. Increasing levels of TIMP-1 were associated with a decreasing probability of response to treatment, reaching borderline significance (OR = 1.59, 95% CI: 0.97-2.62, P = 0.07). This OR is very similar to the result from our previous study. Increasing levels of TIMP-1 were also associated with a shorter disease-free survival and overall survival, however, not statistically significant. The results from the present study support previous data that TIMP-1 is associated with objective response to chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.	2010
19647172	Treatment of HER2-positive breast carcinomatous meningitis with intrathecal administration of alpha-particle-emitting (211)At-labeled trastuzumab.	Carcinomatous meningitis (CM) is a devastating disease characterized by the dissemination of malignant tumor cells into the subarachnoid space along the brain and spine. Systemic treatment with monoclonal antibody (mAb) trastuzumab can be effective against HER2-positive systemic breast carcinoma but, like other therapies, is ineffective against CM. The goal of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of alpha-particle emitting (211)At-labeled trastuzumab following intrathecal administration in a rat model of breast carcinoma CM.	Athymic rats were injected intrathecally with MCF-7/HER2-18 breast carcinoma cells through a surgically implanted indwelling intrathecal catheter. In Experiment 1, animals received 33 or 66 muCi (211)At-labeled trastuzumab, cold trastuzumab or saline. In Experiment 2, animals were inoculated with a lower tumor burden and received 46 or 92 muCi (211)At-labeled trastuzumab or saline. In Experiment 3, animals received 28 muCi (211)At-labeled trastuzumab, 30 muCi (211)At-labeled TPS3.2 control mAb or saline. Histopathological analysis of the neuroaxis was performed at the end of the study.	In Experiment 1, median survival increased from 21 days for the saline and cold trastuzumab groups to 45 and 48 days for 33 and 66 muCi (211)At-labeled trastuzumab, respectively. In Experiment 2, median survival increased from 23 days for saline controls to 68 and 92 days for 46 and 92 muCi (211)At-labeled trastuzumab, respectively. In Experiment 3, median survival increased from 20 days to 29 and 36 days for animals treated with (211)At-labeled TPS3.2 and (211)At-labeled trastuzumab, respectively. Long-term survivors were observed exclusively in the (211)At-trastuzumab-treated groups.	Intrathecal (211)At-labeled trastuzumab shows promise as a treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast CM.	2009
19591159	Sympathetic nerve damage as a potential cause of lymphoedema after axillary dissection for breast cancer.	The physiological disturbances leading to lymphoedema after breast cancer surgery are poorly understood. Damage to sympathetic nerves during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), leading to increased capillary fluid filtration, was investigated as a possible contributory factor.	The integrity of the upper limb sympathetic nervous system was tested in 36 patients before, and 3 and 12 months after ALND. Forearm vascular resistance (FVR), calculated from forearm blood flow and mean systemic arterial pressure, was measured before and after exposure to lower-body negative pressure. Forearm venous compliance was measured using (99m)Tc-labelled autologous erythrocytes and radionuclide plethysmography before and after cold water immersion of the feet.	There were clear changes in FVR and venous compliance in response to sympathetic stimulation but no differences attributable to surgery or between the nine patients who developed lymphoedema and the 27 who did not; nor were there differences between the two arms. There was a trend towards lower preoperative FVR in patients who developed lymphoedema.	Lymphoedema is not the result of sympathetic nerve damage sustained during ALND. Preoperative FVR may help predict who will get lymphoedema following this surgery.	2009
19581485	High definition profiling of mammalian DNA methylation by array capture and single molecule bisulfite sequencing.	DNA methylation stabilizes developmentally programmed gene expression states. Aberrant methylation is associated with disease progression and is a common feature of cancer genomes. Presently, few methods enable quantitative, large-scale, single-base resolution mapping of DNA methylation states in desired regions of a complex mammalian genome. Here, we present an approach that combines array-based hybrid selection and massively parallel bisulfite sequencing to profile DNA methylation in genomic regions spanning hundreds of thousands of bases. This single molecule strategy enables methylation variable positions to be quantitatively examined with high sampling precision. Using bisulfite capture, we assessed methylation patterns across 324 randomly selected CpG islands (CGI) representing more than 25,000 CpG sites. A single lane of Illumina sequencing permitted methylation states to be definitively called for >90% of target sties. The accuracy of the hybrid-selection approach was verified using conventional bisulfite capillary sequencing of cloned PCR products amplified from a subset of the selected regions. This confirmed that even partially methylated states could be successfully called. A comparison of human primary and cancer cells revealed multiple differentially methylated regions. More than 25% of islands showed complex methylation patterns either with partial methylation states defining the entire CGI or with contrasting methylation states appearing in specific regional blocks within the island. We observed that transitions in methylation state often correlate with genomic landmarks, including transcriptional start sites and intron-exon junctions. Methylation, along with specific histone marks, was enriched in exonic regions, suggesting that chromatin states can foreshadow the content of mature mRNAs.	2009
19578753	Molecular analysis of a collection of clinical specimens stored at 4 degrees C as an alternative to snap-freezing.	It is critical for both basic and clinical translational cancer research to use high quality DNA, RNA and proteins from specimens with clinical outcome in order to validate novel diagnostic biomarkers and to monitor successful treatments for patients. However, using current standard procedures, the collection of specimens is often limited by the availability of liquid nitrogen in some hospitals and liquid nitrogen can be hazardous to transport. These problems would be eased if the tissue could be stored unfixed at 4 degrees C, conditions that are readily available in hospitals. Thus the effect of storing tissue specimens at 4 degrees C on the quality of DNA, RNA and protein has been examined. Clinical tissue samples were halved and kept either at 4 degrees C for up to 24 h or snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 30 min of removal from the patient. The results show that the quality of RNA, DNA and protein isolated from the specimens stored at 4 degrees C up to overnight is equal to that obtained from snap-frozen material. In conclusion, simplifying the collection procedure may allow for greater flexibility of conducting studies in units where liquid nitrogen is not readily available.	2009
19528136	Design, conduct, and analyses of Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98: a randomized, double-blind, phase-III study comparing letrozole and tamoxifen as adjuvant endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women with receptor-positive, early breast cancer.	Aromatase inhibitors provide superior disease control when compared with tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer.	To present the design, history, and analytic challenges of the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial: an international, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase-III study comparing the aromatase inhibitor letrozole with tamoxifen in this clinical setting.	From 1998-2003, BIG 1-98 enrolled 8028 women to receive monotherapy with either tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years, or sequential therapy of 2 years of one agent followed by 3 years of the other. Randomization to one of four treatment groups permitted two complementary analyses to be conducted several years apart. The first, reported in 2005, provided a head-to-head comparison of letrozole versus tamoxifen. Statistical power was increased by an enriched design, which included patients who were assigned sequential treatments until the time of the treatment switch. The second, reported in late 2008, used a conditional landmark approach to test the hypothesis that switching endocrine agents at approximately 2 years from randomization for patients who are disease-free is superior to continuing with the original agent.	The 2005 analysis showed the superiority of letrozole compared with tamoxifen. The patients who were assigned tamoxifen alone were unblinded and offered the opportunity to switch to letrozole. Results from other trials increased the clinical relevance about whether or not to start treatment with letrozole or tamoxifen, and analysis plans were expanded to evaluate sequential versus single-agent strategies from randomization.	Due to the unblinding of patients assigned tamoxifen alone, analysis of updated data will require ascertainment of the influence of selective crossover from tamoxifen to letrozole.	BIG 1-98 is an example of an enriched design, involving complementary analyses addressing different questions several years apart, and subject to evolving analytic plans influenced by new data that emerge over time.	2009
19517112	Paraneoplastic Raynaud's phenomenon in a breast cancer survivor.	A 35-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer, treated 3 years ago with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy presented with a rapid onset of severe Raynaud's phenomenon. On physical examination, she had digital ulcers and splinter hemorrhages; there were no signs of an underlying rheumatic condition. Laboratory evaluation revealed anemia, the presence of antinuclear antibody and slight depression in her serum complement C3 level. The remainder of her serologic evaluation, including extractable nuclear antigens, anti-double-stranded DNA antibody, antiphospholipid antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cryoglobulins, and cold agglutins, were negative. Within weeks of her presentation, she developed acute renal failure and bilateral lower extremity edema. A computed tomography scan of her abdomen and pelvis showed bulky lymphadenopathy and hydronephrosis; a pelvic lymph node biopsy revealed metastatic breast cancer. She was initially managed with passive rewarming strategies, topical antibiotics, vasodilator and anti-platelet therapy, but had a negligible response. However, once she was started on chemotherapy for her recurrent malignancy, there was a significant improvement in her Raynaud's symptoms and resolution of her digital ulcers.	2010
19474112	Bone fractures among postmenopausal patients with endocrine-responsive early breast cancer treated with 5 years of letrozole or tamoxifen in the BIG 1-98 trial.	To compare the incidence and timing of bone fractures in postmenopausal women treated with 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen or letrozole for endocrine-responsive early breast cancer in the Breast International Group (BIG) 1-98 trial.	We evaluated 4895 patients allocated to 5 years of letrozole or tamoxifen in the BIG 1-98 trial who received at least some study medication (median follow-up 60.3 months). Bone fracture information (grade, cause, site) was collected every 6 months during trial treatment.	The incidence of bone fractures was higher among patients treated with letrozole [228 of 2448 women (9.3%)] versus tamoxifen [160 of 2447 women (6.5%)]. The wrist was the most common site of fracture in both treatment groups. Statistically significant risk factors for bone fractures during treatment included age, smoking history, osteoporosis at baseline, previous bone fracture, and previous hormone replacement therapy.	Consistent with other trials comparing aromatase inhibitors to tamoxifen, letrozole was associated with an increase in bone fractures. Benefits of superior disease control associated with letrozole and lower incidence of fracture with tamoxifen should be considered with the risk profile for individual patients.	2009
19397505	Sensory function and pain in a population of patients treated for breast cancer.	Chronic pain is often reported after surgery for breast cancer. This study examined pain and sensory abnormalities in women following breast cancer surgery.	Sensory tests were carried out on the operated and contra-lateral side in 55 women with chronic pain after breast cancer treatment and in a reference group of 27 pain-free women, who had also undergone treatment for breast cancer. Testing included a numeric rating score of spontaneous pain, detection and pain threshold to thermal and dynamic mechanical stimuli and temporal summation to repetitive pinprick stimulation. The neuropathic pain symptom inventory was applied for participants with chronic pain.	The mean age was 58.6 years for the pain patients and 60.6 years for the pain-free patients. Thermal thresholds were significantly higher on the operated side than on the contra-lateral side in both groups and side difference in warmth detection threshold was significantly higher in the pain group than in the pain-free group (mean 3.8 degrees C vs. 1.1 degrees C, P=0.01). The frequency of cold allodynia was higher in participants with pain than in pain-free participants (15/53 vs. 1/25, P=0.01), and the frequency of temporal summation evoked by repetitive pinprick was higher in participants with pain than in pain-free participants (23/53 vs. 2/25, P=0.0009). The frequency of dynamic mechanical allodynia did not differ significantly between the two groups.	These findings suggest that chronic pain after surgery for breast cancer is associated with sensory hyperexcitability and is a neuropathic pain condition.	2009
19282197	Preparation and bioevaluation of a 99mTc-labeled chlorambucil analog as a tumor targeting agent.	Chlorambucil belongs to a group of nitrogen mustards which are used for the treatment of variety of cancers. Hence, a chlorambucil derivative has been radiolabeled with [(99m)Tc(CO)(3)(H(2)O)(3)](+) core and its efficacy as a tumor targeting agent has been evaluated. Radiochemical yield of the complex was >98% as observed by HPLC. The in vitro studies in MCF-7 breast cancer cells showed about 30% inhibition of the radiolabeled complex in presence of the cold chlorambucil derivative. Biodistribution studies in Swiss mice bearing fibrosarcoma tumor showed an uptake of 3.2+/-0.3%ID/g at 3h.p.i.	2009
19226661	Rank-based clustering analysis for the time-course microarray data.	Microarray technology allows the monitoring of expression levels for thousands of genes simultaneously. In time-course microarray experiments in which gene expression is monitored over time, we are interested in clustering genes that show similar temporal profiles and identifying genes that show a pre-specified candidate profile. Unfortunately, many traditional clustering methods used for analyzing microarray data do not effectively detect temporal profiles for the time-course microarray data. We propose a rank-based clustering analysis for the time-course microarray data. Our clustering method consists of two steps: the first step discretizes the expression data into groups and then transform them into the rank data, the second step performs the rank-based clustering analysis. Our testing procedure uses the bootstrap samples to select the genes that show similar patterns for the candidate profiles. Simulation study is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed rank-based method. The results are illustrated with the breast cancer data and the Arabidopsis cold stress data.	2009
19219697	Immunologic response induced by synergistic effect of alternating cooling and heating of breast cancer.	In this study, the therapeutic effect and the induced anti-tumor immunity through the alternating cooling and heating was investigated using 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma, a common model of human metastatic breast cancer. While fifteen of seventeen regular mice were cured, primary recurrence and metastasis caused death of all the nude mice within one month after the same treatment. Histological analyses showed that viable cells existed in the tumor debris after the treatment, indicating that the direct killing effect was not the only therapeutic mechanism. Further investigation found rejection of tumor upon re-challenge, and anti-tumor immune response was studied. Stronger cytotoxicity T-lymphocyte (CTL) and Th1 cytokines response as well as infiltration of immunocytes were observed in the treated mice in comparison to those after the surgical resection. The results showed that the alternating cooling and heat could stimulate anti-tumor immunologic response in vivo and the underlying mechanisms will be further investigated in the near future.	2009
19175940	Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a novel partner for MAL2 in breast carcinoma cells.	The MAL2 gene, encoding a four-transmembrane protein of the MAL family, is amplified and overexpressed in breast and other cancers, yet the significance of this is unknown. MAL-like proteins have trafficking functions, but their molecular roles are largely obscure, partly due to a lack of known binding partners.	Yeast two-hybrid screening of a breast carcinoma cDNA expression library was performed using a full-length MAL2 bait, and subsequent deletion mapping experiments were performed. MAL2 interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation analyses and confocal microscopy was employed to compare protein sub-cellular distributions. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of membranes extracted in cold Triton X-100 was employed to compare protein distributions between Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions.	The tumor-associated protein mucin 1 (MUC1) was identified as a potential MAL2 partner, with MAL2/MUC1 interactions being confirmed in myc-tagged MAL2-expressing MCF-10A cells using co-immunoprecipitation assays. Deletion mapping experiments demonstrated a requirement for the first MAL2 transmembrane domain for MUC1 binding, whereas the MAL2 N-terminal domain was required to bind D52-like proteins. Confocal microscopy identified cytoplasmic co-localisation of MUC1 and MAL2 in breast cell lines, and centrifugation of cell lysates to equilibrium in sucrose density gradients demonstrated that MAL2 and MUC1 proteins were co-distributed between Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. However co-immunoprecipitation analyses detected MAL2/MUC1 interactions in Triton X-100-soluble fractions only. Myc-MAL2 expression in MCF-10A cells was associated with both increased MUC1 detection within Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions, and increased MUC1 detection at the cell surface.	These results identify MUC1 as a novel MAL2 partner, and suggest a role for MAL2 in regulating MUC1 expression and/or localisation.	2009
19100404	Renal graft outcome in simultaneous kidney transplantation combined with other organs: experience of a single center.	We report the renal graft outcomes among a series of patients who underwent simultaneous combined liver-kidney transplantations (CLKT) or heart-kidney transplantations (CHKT) at a single center.	From 1975 to December 31, 2007, we performed 1524 kidney transplantations, 427 liver transplantations, and 483 heart transplantations, including 7 simultaneous CLKT and 2 CHKT. We analysed the main patient characteristics, renal graft outcomes, and patient survivals.	CLKT indications were as follows: alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 5) and hepatitis C virus (n = 2) with chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 5), hypertensive nephropathy (n = 1), and polycystic disease (n = 1). Cold renal ischemia time was 6.9 hours (range, 6-9). In 5 patients there were no kidney rejection episodes; 3 of these patients are alive with creatinine levels between 1.4 and 1.7 mg/dL with an average follow-up of 6.9 years (range, 10 months-8 years). One patient died of esophageal cancer at 13 years after transplantation with a serum creatinine level of 1.16 mg/dL and another died of breast cancer at 7 years after transplantation with a creatinine level of 1.1 mg/dL. One patient lost his renal graft just after the kidney transplantation due to renal vein thrombosis. The last patient suffered 1 episode of acute rejection and lost his kidney 5 years later due to chronic rejection. CHKT indications were as follow: dilated myocardiopathy (n = 2) and chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 1) or interstitial nephropathy (n = 1). The cold renal ischemia time was 4 hours. There were no acute rejection episodes. One patient is alive with a creatinine level of 2.05 mg/dL at 6 years after the transplantation; the other patient lost his kidney due to chronic rejection at 270 days after simultaneous CHKT, and 2 years later received a second kidney that is functioning normally.	Simultaneous CLKT and CHKT in selected cases provided satisfactory long-term outcomes in both graft function and patient survival with lesser number of acute rejection episodes than nonsimultaneous transplantations. They are worthy options for patients with liver or heart failure associated with renal failure.	2008
19048620	Cancer mortality in women and men who survived the siege of Leningrad (1941-1944).	The population of Leningrad suffered from severe starvation, cold and psychological stress during the siege in World War II in 1941-1944. We investigated the long-term effects of the siege on cancer mortality in 3,901 men and 1,429 women, born between 1910 and 1940. All study subjects were residents of St. Petersburg, formerly Leningrad, between 1975 and 1982. One third of them had experienced the siege as children, adolescents or young adults (age range, 1-31 years at the peak of starvation in 1941-1942). Associations of siege exposure with risk of death from cancer were studied using a multivariable Cox regression, stratified by gender and period of birth, adjusted for age, smoking, alcohol and social characteristics, from 1975 to 1977 (men) and 1980 to 1982, respectively (women), until the end of 2005. Women who were 10-18 years old at the peak of starvation were taller as adults (age-adjusted difference, 1.7 cm; 95% CI, 0.5-3.0) and had a higher risk of dying from breast cancer compared with unexposed women born during the same period (age-adjusted HR, 9.9; 95% CI, 1.1-86.5). Mortality from prostate cancer was nonsignificantly higher in exposed men. The experience of severe starvation and stress during childhood and adolescence may have long-term effects on cancer in surviving men and women.	2009
19044322	Hypofractionated breast and chest wall irradiation using simultaneous in-field boost IMRT delivered via helical tomotherapy.	Although helical tomotherapy has been described as a means of administering accelerated partial breast irradiation, its practicality in routine whole breast irradiation as part of breast conserving therapy or chest wall irradiation has been questioned. In this technical note we describe our method of whole breast or chest wall irradiation using helical tomotherapy based image-guided, hypofractionated, simultaneous in-field boost intensity modulated radiation therapy. We have observed that excellent dose-distributions can be achieved with helical tomotherapy through a careful selection of treatment planning parameters. Dose homogeneity to the whole breast and simultaneously targeted lumpectomy region appears superior to conventional "tangents" with minimal hot or cold spots. Dose-volume histogram analysis documents effective reduction of high dose to critical sensitive structures (heart and lung) although a greater volume of these non-target organs receives low dose compared to what is typical with tangential beams. Treatment planning is efficient and is usually completed within one to two hours, although physician contouring requires more time and attention than non-IMRT approaches. Pretreatment megavoltage CT (MVCT) imaging has proved invaluable in aiding set-up and engenders greater confidence that the planned IMRT dose distributions are truly being delivered. In some situations, MVCT can provide visual feedback when a seroma or overall breast volume has changed significantly since simulation, thereby identifying cases where replanning might be prudent. Treatment is brief, typically completed in 6 to 9 minutes. Initial clinical application has confirmed the feasibility and practicality of helical tomotherapy as an efficient means of administering radiation therapy for routine breast-conserving therapy and post-mastectomy chest wall irradiation. A simultaneous in-field boost technique reduces the length of the overall course by about a week thereby adding convenience and reducing costs. Further refinements of our technique are being explored and formal prospective clinical evaluation is underway.	2008
19041750	Deregulation of scribble promotes mammary tumorigenesis and reveals a role for cell polarity in carcinoma.	Loss of cell polarity proteins such as Scribble induces neoplasia in Drosophila by promoting uncontrolled proliferation. In mammals, the role that polarity proteins play during tumorigenesis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that depletion of Scribble in mammary epithelia disrupts cell polarity, blocks three-dimensional morphogenesis, inhibits apoptosis, and induces dysplasia in vivo that progress to tumors after long latency. Loss of Scribble cooperates with oncogenes such as c-myc to transform epithelial cells and induce tumors in vivo by blocking activation of an apoptosis pathway. Like depletion, mislocalization of Scribble from cell-cell junction was sufficient to promote cell transformation. Interestingly, spontaneous mammary tumors in mice and humans possess both downregulated and mislocalized Scribble. Thus, we demonstrate that scribble inhibits breast cancer formation and that deregulation of polarity pathways promotes dysplastic and neoplastic growth in mammals by disrupting morphogenesis and inhibiting cell death.	2008
19022771	Delineating the epithelial hierarchy in the mouse mammary gland.	Reconstitution assays have shown that mouse mammary stem cells reside within the mature mammary gland in vivo. Single cells could be prospectively isolated and shown to regenerate an entire mammary gland that exhibited full developmental capacity. The more recent identification of luminal progenitor populations has indicated that the mammary epithelium is organized in a hierarchical manner. Further definition of epithelial cell types in both mouse and human mammary glands will provide insight into the "cells of origin" in the different subtypes of breast cancer, as well as the nature of cancer-propagating cells. Here, we review the known characteristics of mammary stem and progenitor cells, their steroid receptor status, and the pathways that have thus far been implicated in regulating their self-renewal and differentiation.	2008
18982678	Dynamic thermal modeling of the normal and tumorous breast under elastic deformation.	To quantify the complex relationships between (1) the temperature, and temperature differences, on the surface of the breast as recorded by infrared thermal imaging and (2) the underlying physiological and pathological factors, we have developed a dynamic finite element method for comprehensive modeling of both the thermal and elastic properties of normal and tumorous breast tissues. In the steady state, the gravity-induced deformation is found to cause markedly asymmetric surface temperatures even though all thermal-elastic properties are symmetrical. In the dynamic state, the time course of breast thermal imaging in cold-stress and thermal-recovery procedures is found to be useful in characterizing the origins of the thermal contrast on the breast surface. The tumor-induced thermal contrast has slower temporal behavior than the deformation-induced thermal contrast on the breast surface, which may lead to improvements in breast-tumor diagnosis.	2008
18981464	Prognostic and predictive value of centrally reviewed Ki-67 labeling index in postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive breast cancer: results from Breast International Group Trial 1-98 comparing adjuvant tamoxifen with letrozole.	To evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of Ki-67 labeling index (LI) in a trial comparing letrozole (Let) with tamoxifen (Tam) as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.	Breast International Group (BIG) trial 1-98 randomly assigned 8,010 patients to four treatment arms comparing Let and Tam with sequences of each agent. Of 4,922 patients randomly assigned to receive 5 years of monotherapy with either agent, 2,685 had primary tumor material available for central pathology assessment of Ki-67 LI by immunohistochemistry and had tumors confirmed to express estrogen receptors after central review. The prognostic and predictive value of centrally measured Ki-67 LI on disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed among these patients using proportional hazards modeling, with Ki-67 LI values dichotomized at the median value of 11%.	Higher values of Ki-67 LI were associated with adverse prognostic factors and with worse DFS (hazard ratio [HR; high:low] = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4 to 2.3). The magnitude of the treatment benefit for Let versus Tam was greater among patients with high tumor Ki-67 LI (HR [Let:Tam] = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.39 to 0.72) than among patients with low tumor Ki-67 LI (HR [Let:Tam] = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.15; interaction P = .09).	Ki-67 LI is confirmed as a prognostic factor in this study. High Ki-67 LI levels may identify a patient group that particularly benefits from initial Let adjuvant therapy.	2008
18973857	Dosimetric effects of setup uncertainties on breast treatment delivery.	This study aimed to assess the dosimetric impact of setup errors during the delivery of radiotherapy to the breast, and use this information to make recommendations on intervention tolerances for portal imaging of breast treatments. Translational and rotational setup errors were simulated for 10 recent breast patients using an Oncentra MasterPlan treatment planning system. The effect of these errors on the breast and tumor bed target volumes receiving 95% and 107% of the prescribed dose were assessed. For the majority of patients, shifts of up to 10 mm or a 4 degrees patient rotation about the cranio-caudal axis had no significant effect on the dose distribution. Changes in dosimetry were more likely if the reference plan contained large hot or cold spots. For a typical patient, it is estimated that a shift of 5 mm in any one direction, or a 2 degrees patient rotation would not cause more than a 5% change in the target volume receiving between 95% and 107% of the prescribed dose. If combinations of errors occur, greater dosimetric changes would be expected. It is concluded that individual patient shifts of up to 5 mm or rotations about the cranio-caudal axis of 2 degrees or less are unlikely to affect dose-volume histogram parameters by an amount judged as clinically significant. Setup errors exceeding these values may cause large dosimetric changes for some patients, particularly those with larger hot or cold regions in the dose distribution, and intervention is therefore recommended.	2008
18753180	Cutaneous reaction associated with weekly docetaxel administration.	Docetaxel-based chemotherapy will remain clinically relevant and many of our patients will continue to receive the drug. In a recent phase 2 study of docetaxel 35 mg/m2 (weekly) in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of grade 3 cutaneous toxicity is 19%. The skin toxicity observed consists of limb/palmar-plantar erythematous reactions, or fixed-plaque erythrodysesthesia. Case series or reports have reported varied manifestations of skin reactions and include erythema multiforme, nail changes (onycholysis, pigmentation, paronychia), scleroderma, supravenous discoloration, radiation recall dermatitis, and flagellate erythema.	We would like to report four patients with cutaneous reactions resulting from weekly administration of docetaxel.	All cases are heavily pre-treated patients, receiving docetaxel as second or third line therapy. The cutaneous reactions occur at cycle 5. The time between chemotherapy to development of skin lesions is from 1 to 7 days. Lesions usually resolve with desquamation leaving behind areas with hyper-pigmentation or hypo-pigmentation over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. The management strategies include hand elevation, warm or cold compresses, topical and/or systemic antibiotics, topical and/or systemic corticosteroids, and cessation of drug.	There is a need for a systematic approach to manage these cutaneous reactions. Oncology trained pharmacists play vital roles in assessing, managing, documenting and patient education.	2009
18719096	Brk is coamplified with ErbB2 to promote proliferation in breast cancer.	Amplification of the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB2 is frequently observed in breast cancer. Amplification of erbB2 is also associated with multiple genomic gains and losses; however, the importance of these associated changes is largely unknown. We demonstrate that Brk, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, is coamplified and coexpressed with ErbB2 in human breast cancers. ErbB2 interacts with Brk and increases its intrinsic kinase activity. Expression of Brk enhances the ErbB2-induced activation of Ras/MAPK signaling and cyclin E/cdk2 activity to induce cell proliferation of mammary 3-dimensional acini in culture. In a murine model of breast cancer, expression of Brk was found to shorten the latency of ErbB2-induced tumors by promoting cell proliferation, with no effect on protection from apoptosis. Furthermore, overexpression of Brk conferred resistance to the ability of Lapatinib, an ErbB2 kinase inhibitor, to inhibit ErbB2-induced proliferation. Thus, we identified Brk as a drug target for ErbB2-positive cancers.	2008
18719053	Elevated free IGF2 levels in localized, early-stage breast cancer in women.	Epidemiological studies imply an association between circulating IGF1 and breast cancer, whereas the role of IGF2, which also acts on the IGF1 receptor, is less settled. This study investigates the association between IGF2 and breast cancer in patients with localized disease.	The participants were women with well-characterized, early stage, localized breast cancer (n=43) and matched healthy women (n=38), from whom fasting serum levels of IGF-related peptides were measured.	In patients, mean free IGF2 was increased (+57%, P<0.001), in spite of reduced total IGF2 levels (-12%, P=0.003) when compared with controls. Similar changes were seen in free IGF1 (+28%, P=0.004) and total IGF1 (-16% P=NS). Pro-IGF2 and IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) were unchanged. IGFBP2 was reduced by 22% in the patients (P=0.004). The patients showed reduced IGFBP3 protease activity and accordingly increased levels of intact IGFBP3, whereas total IGFBP3 was unchanged.	Women with localized, early-stage breast cancer show elevated circulating free IGF1 and IGF2, reduced total IGF2 and alterations in IGFBPs. The changes observed despite minimal cancer disease suggest a role for the circulating IGF system in the progression of breast cancer in women.	2008
18682712	The postmastectomy pain syndrome: an epidemiological study on the prevalence of chronic pain after surgery for breast cancer.	The prevalence of the postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS) and its clinical characteristics was assessed in a group of patients who had undergone surgery for breast cancer at the Department of Surgery, Odense University Hospital, within the period of 1 May 2003 to 30 April 2004. The study included 258 patients and a reference group of 774 women. A questionnaire was mailed to the patients 1 1/2 year after surgery and to the women in the reference group. The PMPS was defined as pain located in the area of the surgery or ipsilateral arm, present at least 4 days per week and with an average intensity of at least 3 on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10. The prevalence of PMPS was found to be 23.9%. The odds ratio of developing PMPS was 2.88 (95% confidence interval 1.84-4.51). Significant risk factors were as follows: having undergone breast surgery earlier (OR 8.12), tumour located in the upper lateral quarter (OR 6.48) and young age (OR 1.04). This study shows that, although recent advances in the diagnostic and surgical procedures have reduced the frequency of the more invasive surgical procedures, there still is a considerable risk of developing PMPS after treatment of breast cancer.	2008
18588870	An amino acidic adjuvant to augment cryoinjury of MCF-7 breast cancer cells.	One of the major challenges in cryosurgery is to minimize incomplete cryodestruction near the edge of the iceball. In the present study, the feasibility and effectiveness of an amino acidic adjuvant, glycine was investigated to enhance the cryodestruction of MCF-7 human breast cancer cell at mild freezing/thawing conditions via eutectic solidification. The effects of glycine addition on the phase change characteristics of NaCl-water binary mixture were investigated with a differential scanning calorimeter and cryo-macro/microscope. The results confirmed that a NaCl-glycine-water mixture has two distinct eutectic phase change events - binary eutectic solidification of water-glycine, and ternary eutectic solidification of NaCl-glycine-water. In addition, its effects on the cryoinjury of MCF-7 cells were investigated by assessing the post-thaw cellular viability after a single freezing/thawing cycle with various eutectic solidification conditions due to different glycine concentrations, end temperatures and hold times. The viability of MCF-7 cells in isotonic saline supplemented with 10% or 20% glycine without freezing/thawing remained higher than 90% (n=9), indicating no apparent toxicity was induced by the addition of glycine. With 10% glycine supplement, the viability of the cells frozen to -8.5 degrees C decreased from 85.9+/-1.8% to 38.5+/-1.0% on the occurrence of binary eutectic solidification of glycine-water (n=3 for each group). With 20% glycine supplement, the viability of the cells frozen to -8.5 degrees C showed similar trends to those with 10% supplement. However, as the end temperature was lowered to -15 degrees C, the viability drastically decreased from 62.5+/-2.0% to 3.6+/-0.7% (n=3 for each group). The influences of eutectic kinetics such as nucleation temperature, hold time and method were less significant. These results imply that the binary eutectic solidification of water-glycine can augment the cryoinjury of MCF-7 cells, and the extent of the eutectic solidification is significant.	2008
18588689	Linkage disequilibrium mapping of a breast cancer susceptibility locus near RAI/PPP1R13L/iASPP.	Previous results have suggested an association of the region of 19q13.3 with several forms of cancer. In the present study, we investigated 27 public markers within a previously identified 69 kb stretch of chromosome 19q for association with breast cancer by using linkage disequilibrium mapping. The study groups included 434 postmenopausal breast cancer cases and an identical number of individually matched controls.	Studying one marker at a time, we found a region spanning the gene RAI (alias PPP1R13L or iASPP) and the 5' portion of XPD to be associated with this cancer. The region corresponds to a haplotype block, in which there seems to be very limited recombination in the Danish population. Studying combinations of markers, we found that two to four neighboring markers gave the most consistent and strongest result. The haplotypes with strongest association with cancers were located in the gene RAI and just 3' to the gene. Coinciding peaks were seen in the region of RAI in groups of women of different age. In a follow-up to these results we sequenced 10 cases and 10 controls in a 44 kb region spanning the peaks of association. This revealed 106 polymorphisms, many of which were not in the public databases. We tested an additional 44 of these for association with disease and found a new tandem repeat marker, called RAI-3'd1, located downstream of the transcribed region of RAI, which was more strongly associated with breast cancer than any other marker we have tested (RR = 2.44 (1.41-4.23, p = 0.0008, all cases; RR = 6.29 (1.49-26.6), p = 0.01, cases up to 55 years of age).	We expect the marker RAI-3'd1 to be (part of) the cause for the association of the chromosome 19q13.3 region's association with cancer.	2008
18572959	Novel chemically modified analogues of neuropeptide Y for tumor targeting.	The successful use of peptides as potential radiopharmaceuticals essentially requires the modification of the bioactive peptide hormones to introduce chelators for radiolabeling. In this study, four Y 1/Y 2 receptor-selective NPY analogues with different receptor subtype specificities have been investigated. For in vitro studies, the cold metal surrogate was used. Gallium and indium complexes were introduced by using 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid as bifunctional chelator. The peptides were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), the chelator was coupled either at the N-terminus or at the N(epsilon) side chain of Lys(4) of the resin-bound peptide, and the labeling was performed in solution after cleavage. Competitive binding assays showed high binding affinity of the receptor-selective analogues at NPY receptor expressing cells. To test internalization of the novel peptide analogues and the metabolic stability in human blood plasma, the corresponding 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (CF) analogues were prepared and investigated. One of the most promising analogues, the Y 1-receptor selective [Lys(DOTA)(4), Phe(7), Pro(34)]NPY was labeled with (111)In and injected into nude mice that bear MCF-7 breast cancer xenografts, and biodistribution studies were performed. In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that receptor-selective analogues of NPY have promising characteristics for future applications in nuclear medicine for breast tumor diagnosis and therapy.	2008
18565107	Effect of levetiracetam on the postmastectomy pain syndrome.	The aim of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study was to test whether levetiracetam relieves the postmastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS).	Postmastectomy pain syndrome was defined as pain of neuropathic character located in the area of the surgery and/or the ipsilateral arm. The inclusion criteria were: age more than 18 years, characteristic symptoms corresponding to PMPS more than 6 months after surgery for breast cancer, pain duration more than 3 months, peripheral nerve lesions confirmed by abnormal neurological and quantitative sensory tests, intensity of pain more than 4 on a numeric rating scale from 0 to 10 and pain present at least 4 days a week.	Forty-nine patients were screened for participation and 27 patients were included in the study. Twenty-five patients completed two treatment phases of 4 weeks duration with levetiracetam (3000 mg/day) and placebo. There was no difference in the rating of pain relief between treatment with levetiracetam (P = 0.83) and placebo nor when adjusted for possible period effect (P = 0.60). Analysis defining response as pain relief more than 4 on an eleven-point numeric rating scale showed no significant difference between treatment with levetiracetam and placebo (P = 1.00).	Levetiracetam apparently does not relieve peripheral neuropathic pain in PMPS.	2008
18296307	Dietary patterns using Traditional Chinese Medicine principles in epidemiological studies.	Dietary intake and nutritional factors have been shown to be associated with many chronic diseases, such as heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer. There are many approaches to studying dietary intake in relationship to disease; each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. Examples of different methods of studying dietary patterns will be reviewed. In most cultures, consumed and preferred foods are based on cultural and societal influence. Thus, it is important to consider dietary patterns within the context of culture in addition to the standard nutrients or food groupings approach. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers another dimension to food analysis. Our approach classifies dietary intake based on Traditional Chinese Medicine principles of yin and yang, hot and cold, and acidic and alkaline forming food concepts in a case-control study of dietary factors and breast cancer. Our results complement previously reported findings of an increased risk of breast cancer associated with dietary fats in Taiwanese women. Our discussion will focus on the implication of using this dietary pattern research and the challenge of combining this research with culturally sensitive messages to improve health. Our ultimate goal is to design an intervention strategy for disease prevention and health promotion that is culturally appropriate for specific populations.	2008
18473492	The effect of respiratory motion on forward intensity modulated radiotherapy for breast cancer.	This study evaluated the effect of respiratory movement on field-in-field (FIF) forward intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for the treatment of breast cancer. FIF forward IMRT was performed on ten patients receiving radiotherapy to the whole breast after conservation surgery. Assuming that breast motion follows a sophisticated cyclic function, the changes in hot and cold region, dose homogeneity index (DHI), and skin dose were examined at different respiration amplitudes of 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm. FIF forward IMRT significantly improved the hot region, DHI, and skin dose, but slightly worsened the cold region, compared to the two wedged tangential technique (TWT). Interestingly, we found that the respiration amplitude affected the DHI and cold region but had no effect on the hot region and skin dose. The DHI was slightly improved at 1 cm of amplitude probably due to the blurring effect, remained unchanged at 2 cm of amplitude, and was worsened at 3 cm of amplitude. FIF forward IMRT significantly increased the cold region at 2 cm and 3 cm of respiration amplitude compared to the TWT. At 3 cm of respiration amplitude, an average cold region of 3.27 cm(3) was observed. In summary, our data indicate that during FIF forward IMRT, respiration movement has an important effect on various endpoints depending on the respiration amplitude of the patient.	2008
18465343	Bisphosphonate treatment in primary breast cancer: results from a randomised comparison of oral pamidronate versus no pamidronate in patients with primary breast cancer.	During the period from January 1990 to January 1996 a total of 953 patients with lymph node negative primary breast cancer were randomised to oral pamidronate (n=460) 150 mg twice daily for 4 years or no adjuvant pamidronate (n=493) in order to investigate whether oral pamidronate can prevent the occurrence of bone metastases and fractures. The patients received adjuvant chemotherapy, loco-regional radiation therapy, but no endocrine treatment.	During the follow-up period the number of patients with pure bone metastases was 35 in the control group and 31 in the pamidronate group. The number of patients with a combination of bone and other distant metastases were 22 in the control group and 20 in the pamidronate group. The hazard rate ratio for recurrence in bone in the pamidronate group compared to the control group was 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.75-1.40) and p=0.86. No effect was observed on overall survival. In a small subgroup of 27 patients from the study, 12 of whom were treated with pamidronate a significant bone preserving effect was observed on bone mineral density in the lumbar spine, but not in the proximal femur.	The results from the trial do not support a beneficial effect of oral pamidronate on the occurrence of bone metastases or fractures in patients with primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy.	2008
18465340	Tamoxifen for one year versus two years versus 6 months of Tamoxifen and 6 months of megestrol acetate: a randomized comparison in postmenopausal patients with high-risk breast cancer (DBCG 89C).	From January 1, 1990 to December 31, 1994, DBCG conducted a randomised trial in 1 615 postmenopausal women with operable, high-risk, receptor-positive or -unknown breast cancer. The patients were after surgery randomised to Tamoxifen for 1 year (TAM1), Tamoxifen for 2 years (TAM 2) or Tamoxifen for 6 months followed by megestrol acetate for 6 months (TAM/MA). When the preplanned sample size of 1 500 patients was reached it was decided to continue randomisation to TAM1 or TAM2 and the study was finally closed December 31, 1996. With a median follow-up of more than 10 years, there was no difference in disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival (OS) among the three treatment arms. Similar results were obtained in the original and extended comparisons of Tamoxifen for 1 versus 2 years. A multivariate analysis in the per-protocol treated patients did not show significant differences in hazard ratios for DFS or OS among the three arms. Side-effects were rare but more common in the TAM2 and TAM/MA arms.	2008
18465339	DBCG trial 89B comparing adjuvant CMF and ovarian ablation: similar outcome for eligible but non-enrolled and randomized breast cancer patients.	A cohort of premenopausal patients with primary hormone receptor positive breast cancer was prospectively identified to be eligible for the DBCG 89B trial. We perform a long-term follow-up and evaluate the external validity of the trial.	Following registration in a population-based registry, patients were invited to be randomized to ovarian ablation (OA) versus nine courses of three-weekly cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF). The same procedures were used in all patients, including report forms, central review, querying, and analysis of data. Multivariate analysis was used to adjust for differences in base-line characteristics.	Participation in the randomization varied according to center and time period. One thousand six hundred and twenty eight eligible patients were registered and 525 randomized in the DBCG 89B trial. Median estimated follow-up was 9.5 years for disease-free survival and 12.1 years for overall survival. Non-enrolled patients had a disease-free and overall survival similar to randomized patients. Within 5 years of surgery, results were similar following OA and CMF, but disease-free survival was significant inferior with OA more than five years after surgery, adjusted hazard ratio 1.38 (95% CI 1.03 to 1.85; p=0.03). This convened ten years after surgery to an inferior survival with OA, and the adjusted hazard ratio was 2.37 (95% CI 1.43 to 3.91; p<0.01).	This prospective cohort study indicates that eligible patients not participating in the DBCG 89B trial had a similar disease-free and overall survival as participants. Survival was similar after OA and CMF in the first ten years, but became inferior in the OA group 10 or more years after surgery.	2008
18461293	Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.	According to the German definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: 1. Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. 7. Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.	2008

18394814	Comparison of FDG-PET/CT and CT for delineation of lumpectomy cavity for partial breast irradiation.	The success of partial breast irradiation critically depends on proper target localization. We examined the use of fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) for improved lumpectomy cavity (LC) delineation and treatment planning.	Twelve breast cancer patients underwent FDG-PET/CT on a GE Discovery scanner with a median time from surgery to PET/CT of 49 days. The LC was contoured on the CT scan by a radiation oncologist and, together with a nuclear medicine physician, on the PET/CT scan. The volumes were calculated and compared in each patient. Treatment planning target volumes (PTVs) were calculated by expanding the margin 2 cm beyond the LC, maintaining a 5-mm margin from the skin and chest wall, and the treatment plans were evaluated. In addition, a study with a patient-like phantom was conducted to evaluate the effect that the window/level settings might have on contouring.	The margin of the LC was well visualized on all FDG-PET images. The phantom results indicated that the difference between the known volume and the FDG-PET-delineated volume was <10%, regardless of the window/level settings. The PET/CT volumes were larger than the CT volumes in all cases (median volume ratio, 1.68; range, 1.24-2.45; p = 0.004). The PET/CT-based PTVs were also larger than the CT-based PTV (median volume ratio, 1.16; range, 1.08-1.64; p = 0.006). In 9 of 12 patients, a CT-based treatment plan did not provide adequate coverage of the PET/CT-based PTV (99% of the PTV received <95% of the prescribed dose), resulting in substantial cold spots in some plans. In these cases, treatment plans were generated which were specifically designed to cover the larger PET/CT-based PTV. Although these plans showed an increased dose to the normal tissues, the increases were modest: the non-target breast volume receiving > or =50 Gy, lung volume receiving > or =30 Gy, and heart volume receiving > or =5 Gy increased by 5.7%, 0.8%, and 0.2%, respectively. The normal tissue dose-volume objectives were still met with these plans.	The results of our study have shown that FDG-PET/CT can be used to define the LC volume. The increased FDG uptake was likely a result of postoperative inflammation in the LC. The targets defined using PET/CT were significantly larger than those defined with CT alone. Our results have shown that treatment plans can be generated to cover these larger PET/CT target volumes with only a modest increase in irradiated tissue volume compared with CT-determined PTVs.	2008
18303834	Reproducibility of mass spectrometry based protein profiles for diagnosis of breast cancer across clinical studies: a systematic review.	Serum protein profiling by mass spectrometry has achieved attention as a promising technology in oncoproteomics. We performed a systematic review of published reports on protein profiling as a diagnostic tool for breast cancer. The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and COCHRANE databases were searched for original studies reporting discriminatory protein peaks for breast cancer as either protein identity or as m/ z values in the period from January 1995 to October 2006. To address the important aspect of reproducibility of mass spectrometry data across different clinical studies, we compared the published lists of potential discriminatory peaks with those peaks detected in an original MALDI MS protein profiling study performed by our own research group. A total of 20 protein/peptide profiling studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Only 3 reports included information on protein identity. Although the studies revealed a considerable heterogeneity in relation to experimental design, biological variation, preanalytical conditions, methods of computational data analysis, and analytical reproducibility of profiles, we found that 45% of peaks previously reported to correlate with breast cancer were also detected in our experimental study. Furthermore, 25% of these redetected peaks also showed a significant difference between cases and controls in our study. Thus, despite known problems related to reproducibility, we were able to demonstrate overlap in peaks between clinical studies indicating some convergence toward a set of common discriminating, reproducible peaks for breast cancer. These peaks should be further characterized for identification of the protein identity and validated as biomarkers for breast cancer.	2008
18303830	Combined experimental and statistical strategy for mass spectrometry based serum protein profiling for diagnosis of breast cancer: a case-control study.	Serum protein profiling by mass spectrometry is a promising method for early detection of cancer. We have implemented a combined strategy based on matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) and statistical data analysis for serum protein profiling and applied it in a well-described breast cancer case-control study. A rigorous sample collection protocol ensured high quality specimen and reduced bias from preanalytical factors. Preoperative serum samples obtained from 48 breast cancer patients and 28 controls were used to generate MALDI MS protein profiles. A total of nine mass spectrometric protein profiles were obtained for each serum sample. A total of 533 common peaks were defined and represented a 'reference protein profile'. Among these 533 common peaks, we identified 72 peaks exhibiting statistically significant intensity differences (p < 0.01) between cases and controls. A diagnostic rule based on these 72 mass values was constructed and exhibited a cross-validated sensitivity and specificity of approximately 85% for the detection of breast cancer. With this method, it was possible to distinguish early stage cancers from controls without major loss of sensitivity and specificity. We conclude that optimized serum sample handling and mass spectrometry data acquisition strategies in combination with statistical analysis provide a viable platform for serum protein profiling in cancer diagnosis.	2008
18256929	Systemic targeting of metastatic human breast tumor xenografts by Coxsackievirus A21.	Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in women worldwide. Metastatic development is associated with poor prognosis and current therapies provide only limited success. Virotherapy is an emerging strategy for the treatment of cancer that utilizes both replication-competent and genetically modified viruses to selectively kill tumor cells. We have previously shown that Coxsackievirus A21 (CVA21), a wild-type common-cold producing enterovirus, is an effective oncolytic agent against human melanoma xenografts in vivo. CVA21 specifically targets and lytically infects susceptible cells expressing the CVA21 cellular receptors, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and/or decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Herein, the efficacy of CVA21 as a therapeutic agent against human breast cancer was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the human breast cancer cell lines examined expressed significantly elevated levels of surface ICAM-1 and DAF compared to normal breast cell lines, and that all cancerous lines were more susceptible to lytic infection by CVA21 than the normal cells. Through the use of subcutaneous (T47D cells) and orthotopic (MDA-MB-231-luc cells) xenograft SCID mouse models it was demonstrated that a single intravenous injection of CVA21 produced significant regression of pre-established tumors in vivo, as well as targeting and elimination of metastases in the orthotopic model. Taken together, these findings highlight the exciting potential of CVA21 as a therapeutic agent against both primary and metastatic human breast cancer.	2009
18239125	Profiling essential genes in human mammary cells by multiplex RNAi screening.	By virtue of their accumulated genetic alterations, tumor cells may acquire vulnerabilities that create opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We have devised a massively parallel strategy for screening short hairpin RNA (shRNA) collections for stable loss-of-function phenotypes. We assayed from 6000 to 20,000 shRNAs simultaneously to identify genes important for the proliferation and survival of five cell lines derived from human mammary tissue. Lethal shRNAs common to these cell lines targeted many known cell-cycle regulatory networks. Cell line-specific sensitivities to suppression of protein complexes and biological pathways also emerged, and these could be validated by RNA interference (RNAi) and pharmacologically. These studies establish a practical platform for genome-scale screening of complex phenotypes in mammalian cells and demonstrate that RNAi can be used to expose genotype-specific sensitivities.	2008
18224398	Preclinical studies of molecular-targeting diagnostic and therapeutic strategies against breast cancer.	We have investigated protein kinase C (PKC) signaling, a putative differentiation-related and metastasis suppressor gene Cap43/NDRG1/Drg-1, and Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) to identify new molecular targeting for breast cancer. PKC is a family of serine/threonine kinases that is involved in the regulation of cell growth. We have demonstrated that PKC caused G(1) arrest in a breast cancer cell line through a mechanism involving a PKC-ERK MAPK-JNK-Rb protein signaling pathway. We have also characterized a novel mechanism through which all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and antineoplaston, anticancer drug, caused cell growth inhibition in breast cancer cells through effects on intracellular pathways. ATRA decreased the expression of PKCalpha, as well as reduced ERK MAPK phosphorylation, and consequently caused G(1) arrest. Antineoplaston caused the down-regulation of PKCalpha protein expression, resulting in inhibition of ERK MAPK phosphorylation, with resultant inhibition of Rb phosphorylation leading to G(1) arrest. PKC signaling represents a promising target for development of novel therapeutic agents. Cap43 is known as N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1). Treatment with estradiol (E(2)) significantly decreased the expression of Cap43 in ER-alpha-positive breast cancer cell lines. Co-administration of tamoxifen abrogated the E(2)-induced downregulation of Cap43 in ER-alpha-positive cell lines. These results suggested that Cap43 may hold the potential of being a molecular marker to determine the therapeutic efficacy of anti-estrogenic anticancer agents in breast cancer. YB-1 is a member of the cold shock domain protein family. The expression of nuclear YB-1 was correlated with HER2 positively in clinical specimens of human breast cancer. Immunostaining studies showed that nuclear YB-1 expression was an independent prognostic factor of overall survival. Expression of nuclear YB-1 played an essential role in acquirement of malignant characteristics through HER2-dependent pathways in breast cancer patients. PKC, Cap43 and YB-1 may be useful in new molecular-targeting diagnosis and therapeutics in breast cancer.	2008
18210299	Does the introduction of sentinel node biopsy increase the number of node positive patients with early breast cancer? A population based study form the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group.	The validation series of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in the treatment of breast cancer have shown that 10-20% more lymph node metastases are detected. However, their impact has never been studied in populations where the method has been fully implemented. In a population-based setting, the objective of the current study was to estimate the increased risk of metastases after introduction of the sentinel lymph node biopsy technique.	We identified all new breast cancer patients in three different counties in two time periods (1996-1997 and 2002-2003). The study cohort was comprised of 2 932 patients. The main outcome was the frequency of patients with metastases. The frequencies of patients with metastases were compared as well as adjusted (using a multivariate logistic regression) and unadjusted odds-ratio for detecting lymph node metastases.	In counties where sentinel lymph node biopsy was implemented, the frequency of patients with lymph node metastases increased significantly 7.3% (95% CI: 1.0-13.7%) and 13.3% (95% CI: 7.3-19.3%), respectively. In the county without sentinel lymph node biopsy, an insignificant increase of 6.9% (-0.1-13.9%) in the frequency of patients with metastases was seen. The adjusted odds- ratio for detecting lymph node metastases was 1.41 (1.07-1.87) and 1.70 (1.30-2.23) in the counties with SLNB.	The frequency of patients with metastases increased significantly in counties where sentinel lymph node biopsy was implemented.	2008
18181248	Reproducibility of serum protein profiling by systematic assessment using solid-phase extraction and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.	Protein profiling of human serum by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) is potentially a new diagnostic tool for early detection of human diseases, including cancer. Sample preparation is a key issue in MALDI MS and the analysis of complex samples such as serum requires optimized, reproducible methods for handling and deposition of protein samples. Data acquisition in MALDI MS is also a critical issue, since heterogeneity of sample deposits leads to attenuation of ion signals in MALDI MS. In order to improve the robustness and reproducibility of MALDI MS for serum protein profiling we investigated a range of sample preparation techniques and developed a statistical method based on repeated analyses for evaluation of protein-profiling performance of MALDI MS. Two different solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods were investigated, namely custom-made microcolumns and commercially available magnetic beads. Using these two methods, nineteen different sample preparation methods for serum profiling by MALDI MS were systematically tested with regard to matrix selection, stationary phase, selectivity, and reproducibility. Microcolumns were tested with regard to chromatographic properties; reversed phase (C8, C18, SDB-XC), ion-exchange (anion, weak cation, mixed-phase (SDB-RPS)) and magnetic beads were tested with regard to chromatographic properties; reversed phase (C8) or affinity chromatography (Cu-IMAC). The reproducibility of each sample preparation method was determined by enumeration and analysis of protein signals that were detected in at least six out of nine spectra obtained by three triplicate analyses of one serum sample.A candidate for best overall performance as evaluated by the number of peaks generated and the reproducibility of mass spectra was found among the tested methods. Up to 418 reproducible peaks were detected in one cancer serum sample. These protein peaks can be part of a possible diagnostic profile, suggesting that this sample preparation method and data acquisition approach is suitable for large-scale analysis of serum samples for protein profiling.	2008
19693373	A microfluidic platform for studying the effects of small temperature gradients in an incubator environment.	Studies on the effects of variations in temperature and mild temperature gradients on cells, gels, and scaffolds are important from the viewpoint of biological function. Small differences in temperature are known to elicit significant variations in cell behavior and individual protein reactivity. For the study of thermal effects and gradients in vitro, it is important to develop microfluidic platforms which are capable of controlling temperature gradients in an environment which mimics the range of physiological conditions. In the present paper, such a microfluidic thermal gradient system (muTGS) system is proposed which can create and maintain a thermal gradient throughout a cell-seeded gel matrix using the hot and cold water supply integrated in the system in the form of a countercurrent heat exchanger. It is found that a uniform temperature gradient can be created and maintained in the device even inside a high temperature and high humidity environment of an incubator. With the help of a hot and cold circuit controlled from outside the incubator the temperature gradient can be regulated. A numerical simulation of the device demonstrates the thermal feature of the chip. Cell viability and activity under a thermal gradient are examined by placing human breast cancer cells in the device.	2008
18002249	Immunological response induced by alternated cooling and heating of breast tumor.	A new in-situ thermal physical method combining both cryosurgery and local hyperthermia was used to treat mice bearing 4T1 murine mammary carcinoma. The induced anti-tumor immune response was investigated. The cryo/heat treatment resulted in stimulation of CTL response and attraction of immunocytes into the tumor debris, which correlated well to the tumor rejection in re-implantation. The results suggested that alternated cooling and heating had synergistic effect and might be developed into an alternative modality for tumor therapy.	2007
17994793	Cryoinjury of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and inhibition of post-thaw recovery using TNF-alpha.	Cryoinjury of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and its enhancement using tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) as an adjuvant, were investigated. Through a series of experiments in a two level factorial design critical parameters affecting cryotherapy responses were identified. The cryoinjury was investigated by quantifying the effects of four freeze/thaw (F/T) parameters, selected to be within the expected range for a cryosurgical iceball. Thermal parameters considered were cooling rate (5 and 50 degrees C/min), end temperature (-20 and -80 degrees C), hold time (0 and 10 min), and thawing rate (20 and 100 degrees C/min). After exposing the cells to the selected F/T conditions, survival was assessed and statistically analyzed to determine the effect of each parameter and their interactions. A statistical analysis shows that the end temperature and hold time were the two most significant parameters in the range studied. This suggests that proper control of these two parameters is important to achieve desired cryodestruction of MCF-7 cells. Enhancement of cryoinjury by TNF-alpha was also investigated in a tissue equivalent cryoinjury model in which a cryosurgical iceball is formed. MCF-7 cells cultured in a collagen matrix underwent a controlled F/T with or without TNF-alpha pre-treatment at 100 ng/ml for 24 hours. Post-thaw viability of MCF-7 cells was assessed at three hours, and at one and three days after freezing. Although the TNF-alpha treatment alone induced neither apoptotic nor necrotic cell death, the combination of TNF-alpha pre-treatment and freezing enhanced the immediate cryoinjury of MCF-7 cells, and significantly impaired the post-thaw recovery. Without TNF-alpha treatment, MCF-7 cell cultures were repopulated, reaching approximately 80% survival at day 3 even after severe cryoinjury (< or = 20% survival) at three hours. In contrast, this repopulation was significantly inhibited by TNF-alpha pre-treatment, in which case the viability of the frozen region remained below 40% at day 3. The effects of TNF-alpha on the cryoinjury of MCF-7 cells suggest that TNF-alpha may serve as a potent adjuvant to cryosurgery of breast cancer.	2007
17976925	Human adiposity, longevity and reproduction features as consequences of population bottlenecks.	A model of the origin of modern humans through several population bottlenecks caused by glacial cycles and cold-arid periods was used as a frame for describing occurrence of unique physiological characteristics. Occurrence of regular evening food sharing among the hominid group members improved their chances of finding food the next day. It allowed slow emergence of a gracile and energy efficient phenotype. Improving chances of group survival in the harsh environment included these traits: - The menstrual cycle occurrence in the common ancestor of human and great apes. - Single pregnancies only in women with sufficient fat reserves. Ovulations stop during the food shortage seasons, or longer periods of starvation and during lactation. - Women prone to obesity sooner become pregnant, passing the obesity trait as an advantage. - Seldom pregnancies separated by several years of anovulation made a strong pressure toward the longevity of women and man. - Menopausis improved the group survival through preventing pregnancy of women to old to deliver and raise children without significant risks. The modern times food abundance results in high incidences of adiposity, diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Continuos ovulations from puberty to menopausis except during seldom pregnancies and lactations is considered responsible for the occurrence of estrogen induced breast and endometrial cancers. The combination of longevity with decades of androgen secretion is the main cause of prostate cancer.	2008
17912030	Copy-number variants in patients with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer.	Copy-number variants such as germ-line deletions and amplifications are associated with inherited genetic disorders including familial cancer. The gene or genes responsible for the majority of familial clustering of pancreatic cancer have not been identified. We used representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis (ROMA) to characterize germ-line copy number variants in 60 cancer patients from 57 familial pancreatic cancer kindreds. Fifty-seven of the 60 patients had pancreatic cancer and three had nonpancreatic cancers (breast, ovary, ovary). A familial pancreatic cancer kindred was defined as a kindred in which at least two first-degree relatives have been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Copy-number variants identified in 607 individuals without pancreatic cancer were excluded from further analysis. A total of 56 unique genomic regions with copy-number variants not present in controls were identified, including 31 amplifications and 25 deletions. Two deleted regions were observed in two different patients, and one in three patients. The germ-line amplifications had a mean size of 662 Kb, a median size of 379 Kb (range 8.2 Kb to 2.5 Mb) and included 425 known genes. Examples of genes included in the germ-line amplifications include the MAFK, JunD and BIRC6 genes. The germ-line deletions had a mean size of 375Kb, a median size 151 Kb (range 0.4 Kb to 2.3 Mb) and included 81 known genes. In multivariate analysis controlling for region size, deletions were 90% less likely to involve a gene than were duplications (p < 0.01). Examples of genes included in the germ-line deletions include the FHIT, PDZRN3 and ANKRD3 genes. Selected deletions and amplifications were confirmed using real-time PCR, including a germ-line amplification on chromosome 19. These genetic copy-number variants define potential candidate loci for the familial pancreatic cancer gene.	2007
17909809	The impact of delay in cryo-fixation on biomarkers of Src tyrosine kinase activity in human breast and bladder cancers.	Demonstration of pharmacodynamic activity of new, targeted cancer drugs in tumour tissue is potentially important in guiding early drug development. However, delays between tumour sampling and sample fixation may result in variability of pharmacodynamic biomarkers. The aim of this study, was to assess the impact of delays in fixation on biomarkers of Src kinase activity. A total of 20 patients with locally advanced breast cancer and 5 with early bladder cancer had multiple tissue samples taken which were fixed at documented time points up to 60 min after biopsy. These were examined to determine if the amount of Paxillin, phospho-Paxillin, phospho-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and total phospho-Tyrosine changed over time, using a quantitative lysate immunoassay. In breast cancer, there was an increase in the amount of phospho-Paxillin (60% per h; P = 0.019) up to 60 min after biopsy. The amount of total Paxillin decreased (28% per h; P = 0.034) over the same time course. In early bladder cancer, no changes were noted in any endpoints up to 45 min. Standardisation of the time taken between biopsy and fixation may be critical, particularly in studies using phosphorylated protein biomarkers.	2008
17591835	Adjuvant strategies in breast cancer: new prospectives, questions and reflections at the end of 2007 St Gallen International Expert Consensus Conference.	Breast cancer detection and staging are constantly evolving as technologies improve. Breast cancer surgery is also undergoing continuous refinement, with the objective being to achieve optimal cosmetic results. Surgery has been combined with intraoperative radiation therapy to achieve the best local-disease control with minimal side-effects. The adjuvant strategy of treatment is a 'hot' issue in this 'scenario'. Every 2 years at St Gallen, a nice and cold town in the north of Switzerland, more of 4000 breast cancer experts arrive from every part of the world, to improve their knowledge in this issue. The Consensus Conference with the discussion of 40 international panelists is the zenith of the conference. This report provides a brief presentation and reflections, immediately at the end of the conference, with the objective being to stimulate ideas regarding what should be done tomorrow.	2007
17888670	131I labeling of tamoxifen and biodistribution studies in rats.	Tamoxifen [TAM ([Z]-2-[4-(1,2-diphenyl-1-di-butenyl)-phenoxy]-N,N-dimethylethanamine)] has been used as an antiestrogen drug for treatment and prevention of human breast cancer. Tamoxifen was labeled with 131I using iodogen as an oxidizing agent. Mass spectroscopy of the cold standard showed that the labeling occurs in ortho position to the phenyl ether position of TAM as expected. Quality control, radiochemical yield and stability were established using the radioelectrophoresis method. The radiolabeled compound maintained its stability throughout working period of 24 h. Scintigraphic imaging was performed and tissue distribution was determined in Albino Wistar rats. According to biodistribution and imaging experiments the radiolabeled compound presented estrogen receptor (ER) specificity and it was uptaken by endometrium as well as breast tissue.	2008
17877956	[Primary inoperable breast cancer].	2-5% of breast cancers are locally advanced (LABC). The standard treatment is neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) with an anthracycline-based regimen followed by surgery and adjuvant therapy. Pathological complete response (pCR) to NC is correlated to survival. However, only a small percentage of patients achieve pCR and the prognosis is poor. Addition of paclitaxel or docetaxel increases clinical and pathologic response rates. In addition trastuzumab seems effective. Prediction of treatment response may be guided by novel biotechnological approaches.	2007
17875763	Comparison of gene sets for expression profiling: prediction of metastasis from low-malignant breast cancer.	In the low-risk group of breast cancer patients, a subgroup experiences metastatic recurrence of the disease. The aim of this study was to examine the performance of gene sets, developed mainly from high-risk tumors, in a group of low-malignant tumors.	Twenty-six tumors from low-risk patients and 34 low-malignant T2 tumors from patients with slightly higher risk have been examined by genome-wide gene expression analysis. Nine prognostic gene sets were tested in this data set.	A 32-gene profile (HUMAC32) that accurately predicts metastasis has previously been developed from this data set. In the present study, six of the eight other gene sets have prognostic power in the low-malignant patient group, whereas two have no prognostic value. Despite a relatively small overlap between gene sets, there is high concordance of classification of samples. This, together with analysis of functional gene groups, indicates that the same pathways may be represented by several of the gene sets. However, the results suggest that low-risk patients may be classified more accurately with gene signatures developed especially for this patient group.	Several gene sets, mainly developed in high-risk cancers, predict metastasis from low-malignant cancer.	2007
17760415	Radiolabeling of bombesin-like peptide with 99mTc: 99mTc-litorin and biodistribution in rats.	Bombesin-like peptides are related to several human cancer receptors, including small cell lung, prostate, breast, colon, and pancreatic cancers. Litorin, an amphibian bombesin peptide derivative, is found to stimulate the contraction of smooth muscle, to stimulate gastrin, gastric acid, and pancreatic secretion, and to suppress the nutriment in in vivo experiments. In the present study, litorin was labeled with 99mTc by the stannous chloride procedure. Labeling yield is 95 +/- 1.4%, as determined by radio thin layer chromatography (RTLC) and radio high performance chromatography (RHPLC). Results of in vitro studies demonstrated a high stability in serum and cysteine solutions. In vivo biodistribution was investigated with normal male Albino Wistar rats. Biodistribution data showed fast clearance, low intestinal accumulation, and significant uptake in bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide (BN/GRP) receptor rich tissues such as the pancreas (23.56 +/- 0.01 %ID/g 30 min pi). It can be blocked partially by previous administration of 'cold' litorin. The results showed specificity of the uptake. As 99mTc-litorin displays good radiolabeling and biodistribution, it is a potentially useful radiopharmaceutical for detection of bombesin receptor-expressing cancers.
17707312	Functional imaging of estrogen receptors with radiolabeled-GAP-EDL in rabbit endometriosis model.	Endometriosis is a common women's health problem. Animal models provide an invaluable tool to study the natural history of endometriosis. We previously have reported that (99m)Tc-labeled glutamate peptide-estradiol ((99m)Tc-GAP-EDL) is a useful agent for imaging functional estrogen receptor (ER) via an ER-mediated process. This study was to evaluate the feasibility of using radiolabeled GAP-EDL to image ER-positive (ER +) endometriosis in nonprimate animal models.	3-Aminoethyl estradiol (EDL) was conjugated to glutamate peptide (GAP) to yield GAP-EDL. In vitro cellular uptake studies of (99m)Tc and (68)Ga-GAP-EDL inhibition with cold estrone were conducted in 13,762 rat mammary tumor cells. To create a rabbit model with endometriosis, part of uterine tissue was dissected and grafted in the peritoneal wall. Eight weeks after surgery, scintigraphic images were obtained after intravenous injection of (99m)Tc-GAP-EDL (1 mCi/rabbit, intravenous) at 0.5-2.0 hours, and (68)Ga-GAP-EDL at 45 minutes. We also performed (68)Ga-GAP-EDL blocking study in rabbit model by using tamoxifen. The rabbits were sacrificed and the grafts were excised for histologic examination.	In vitro uptake study of (99m)Tc- and (68)Ga-GAP-EDL in 13,762 rat breast cancer cells showed gradually increasing uptake of both tracers. Accumulation of (68)Ga-GAP-EDL in 13,762 cells was inhibited with cold estrone in a dose-dependent manner. In the endometriosis model, the grafted uterine tissue could be visualized by (99m)Tc-GAP-EDL. Necropsy was performed at 2.5 hours after injection time. Four follicular endometrial lesions in eight implanted endometrial tissues were detected, and all lesions could be detected by (99m)Tc-GAP-EDL. Planar scintigraphy of uterus, ovary and implants of necropsy specimen revealed an increased uptake of (99m)Tc-GAP-EDL in comparison with surrounding abdominal wall tissue. Microscopic examinations support that (99m)Tc-GAP-EDL was accumulated in the microinvasive endometrial tissue. After blocking with tamoxifen, (68)Ga-GAP-EDL accumulation in the endometrial grafts could not be visualized, and endometrial tissue-to-normal tissue count ratios were statistically higher in a nonblocked image than that in the blocked image.	Endometriosis uptake of radiolabeled GAP-EDL was via an estrogen receptor-mediated process. Radiolabeled-GAP-EDLs are useful agents for imaging endometriosis.	2007
17701731	Sensitivity after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and immediate reconstruction.	The purpose of this retrospective study was to evaluate the cutaneous somatosensory function and patients' subjective experience after bilateral prophylactic mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with implants. Twenty-four patients treated during an eight-year period were included. Somatosensory examination was made at least two years after the latest surgery to study perception thresholds to touch, warmth, cold, and heat pain, using quantitative techniques. Patients also completed a questionnaire about subjective sensitivity. Sixteen women who had had no previous breast surgery were used as a control group. Most patients reported decreased sensitivity in the breasts, which was confirmed by the results from the quantitative somatosensory examination. The results also showed that the ability to experience sexual feelings in the breast is usually lost after this type of operation, and as many as 14 patients reported spontaneous or stimulus-evoked discomfort in the breasts.	2007
17671732	Optimization of an RNA isolation procedure from plasma samples.	In this study, we aimed to optimize the isolation procedure of circulating RNA from large volumes of plasma. Simultaneously, the stability and integrity of RNA from plasma samples were examined. To investigate the isolation of circulating RNA, reverse transcription-PCR analysis in combination with capillary electrophoresis was used. The presence of amplifiable RNA in plasma from healthy volunteers and from breast cancer patients was analyzed. We found that circulating RNA in plasma was highly fragmented and degraded. Plasma RNA was most efficiently isolated from large volumes of samples after introducing the step of plasma concentration by evaporation and by using TRIzol LS reagent. A single freeze/thaw process had no significant effect on RNA integrity and quantity of plasma RNA. The average amount of RNA in plasma from breast cancer patients was lower than in plasma from healthy volunteers. The concentrating of large volumes of plasma facilitates isolation of plasma RNA and yields amplifiable RNA for at least fragments that are up to 310 bp long.	2007
17602102	Developing and validating a measure of Chinese cultural views of health and cancer.	To develop and validate quantitative scales that measure Chinese cultural views about health and cancer, cultural views were assessed by a 30-item scale through telephone interviews with 438 Chinese-American women aged 50 and older. Cultural subscales were identified using principal component analysis and validated by their associations with age at immigration and breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer (CRC) screening patterns. The overall scale had good reliability (Cronbach's alpha = .79). Factor analysis yielded seven cultural subscales-fatalism, hot-cold balance, use of herbs, self-care, medical examination, lifestyle, and Western medicine (alpha = .39 to .82). The majority of the cultural subscales were significantly associated with age at immigration (p < .001). Fatalism, Self-Care, and Medical Examination subscales consistently predicted nonadherence to breast, cervical, and CRC screening recommendations, even after considering other factors. Chinese cultural views consist of at least seven domains and may influence older women's breast, cervical, and CRC screening.	2008
17593038	Long-term sensibility following nonautologous, immediate breast reconstruction.	Immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy, using submuscular expander prostheses, is well established in the treatment of breast cancer. The aim of this study was to survey the postoperative cutaneous somatosensory status and to analyze the patients' subjective opinion about the sensibility in the reconstructed breast. Fourteen patients were included and examined 3-6 years after reconstruction. The untreated contralateral breast served as control. None of the patients had received any locoregional radiotherapy. The perception thresholds to touch, cold, warmth, and heat pain were assessed and a questionnaire about the patients' subjective experience of sensibility was completed. In the quantitative somatosensory testing, statistically significant impairment concerning all the examined modalities was demonstrated. The least affected was the heat pain modality. In the questionnaire, the patients reported weaker nonmodality specific sensibility from the reconstructed breast compared with the control breast. More than half of the patients reported that the reconstructed breast felt like a real breast. In conclusion, the study revealed long-term, overall sensibility impairment following nonautologous, immediate breast reconstruction.
17575055	Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells are a major determinant of nascent tumor neovascularization.	Tumors build vessels by cooption of pre-existing vasculature and de novo recruitment of bone marrow (BM)-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). However, the contribution and the functional role of EPCs in tumor neoangiogenesis are controversial. Therefore, by using genetically marked BM progenitor cells, we demonstrate the precise spatial and temporal contribution of EPCs to the neovascularization of three transplanted and one spontaneous breast tumor in vivo using high-resolution microscopy and flow cytometry. We show that early tumors recruit BM-derived EPCs that differentiate into mature BM-derived endothelial cells (ECs) and luminally incorporate into a subset of sprouting tumor neovessels. Notably, in later tumors, these BM-derived vessels are diluted with non-BM-derived vessels from the periphery, which accounts for purported differences in previously published reports. Furthermore, we show that specific ablation of BM-derived EPCs with alpha-particle-emitting anti-VE-cadherin antibody markedly impaired tumor growth associated with reduced vascularization. Our results demonstrate that BM-derived EPCs are critical components of the earliest phases of tumor neoangiogenesis.	2007
17470850	Neurotoxicity from oxaliplatin combined with weekly bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin as surgical adjuvant chemotherapy for stage II and III colon cancer: NSABP C-07.	The randomized, multicenter, phase III protocol C-07 compared the efficacy of adjuvant bolus fluorouracil and leucovorin (FULV) versus FULV with oxaliplatin (FLOX) in stage II or III colon cancer. Definitive analysis revealed an increase in 4-year disease-free survival from 67.0% to 73.2% in favor of FLOX. This study compares neurotoxicity between the treatments.	Neurotoxicity was recorded for all patients using standard adverse event reporting. Patients at select institutions completed a neurotoxicity questionnaire through 18 months of follow-up.	A total of 2,492 patients enrolled onto C-07 and 400 patients enrolled onto the patient-reported substudy. Mean patient-reported neurotoxicity was higher with oxaliplatin throughout the 18 months of study (P < .0001). During therapy, patients receiving oxaliplatin experienced significantly more hand/foot toxicity (eg, "quite a bit" of cold-induced hand/foot pain 26% FLOX v 2.6% FULV) and overall weakness (eg, moderate weakness in 27.4% FLOX v 16.2% FULV). At 18 months, hand neuropathy had diminished, but patients who received oxaliplatin experienced continued foot discomfort (eg, moderate foot numbness and tingling for 22.1% FLOX v 4.6% FULV). Observer-reported neurotoxicity was low grade and primarily neurosensory rather than neuromotor. Sixty-eight percent in the FLOX group v 8% in the FULV group had neurotoxicity at their first on-treatment assessment. Time to resolution was significantly longer for those receiving oxaliplatin, and continued beyond 2 years for more than 10% in the oxaliplatin group.	Oxaliplatin causes significant neurotoxicity. It is experienced primarily in the hands during therapy and in the feet during follow-up. In a minority of patients the neurotoxicity is long lasting.	2007

17349579	A brake becomes an accelerator: PTP1B--a new therapeutic target for breast cancer.	The protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP1B, previously recognized for its role in downregulating insulin and leptin signaling, has now been shown to function as a positive regulator of signaling events associated with breast tumorigenesis. Inhibitors of PTP1B that have been developed as drug candidates for treatment of diabetes and obesity may offer new avenues for the treatment of breast cancer.	2007
17306974	Improved outcome from substituting methotrexate with epirubicin: results from a randomised comparison of CMF versus CEF in patients with primary breast cancer.	We compared the efficacy of CEF (cyclophosphamide, epirubicin, and fluorouracil) against CMF (cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil) in moderate or high risk breast cancer patients. We randomly assigned 1224 patients with completely resected unilateral breast cancer to receive nine cycles of three-weekly intravenous CMF or CEF. Patients were encouraged to take part in a parallel trial comparing oral pamidronate 150 mg twice daily for 4 years versus control (data not shown). Substitution of methotrexate with epirubicin significantly reduced the unadjusted hazard for disease-free survival (DFS) by 16% (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI; 0.71-0.99) and for overall survival by 21% (hazard ratio 0.79; 95% CI; 0.66-0.94). The risk of secondary leukaemia and congestive heart failure was similar in the two groups. Overall CEF was superior over CMF in terms of DFS and OS in patients with operable breast cancer without subsequent increase in late toxicities.	2007
17278486	Development of a computer-aided diagnostic scheme for detection of interval changes in successive whole-body bone scans.	Bone scintigraphy is the most frequent examination among various diagnostic nuclear medicine procedures. It is a well-established imaging modality for the diagnosis of osseous metastasis and for monitoring osseous tumor response to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Although the sensitivity of bone scan examinations for detection of bone abnormalities has been considered to be relatively high, it is time consuming to identify multiple lesions such as bone metastases of prostate and breast cancers. In addition, it is very difficult to detect subtle interval changes between two successive abnormal bone scans, because of variations in patient conditions, the accumulation of radioisotopes during each examination, and the image quality of gamma cameras. Therefore, we developed a new computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) scheme for the detection of interval changes in successive whole-body bone scans by use of a temporal subtraction image which was obtained with a nonlinear image-warping technique. We carried out 58 pairs of successive bone scans in which each scan included both posterior and anterior views. We determined 107 "gold-standard" interval changes among the 58 pairs based on the consensus of three radiologists. Our computerized scheme consisted of seven steps, i.e., initial image density normalization on each image, image matching for the paired images, temporal subtraction by use of the nonlinear image-warping technique, initial detection of interval changes by use of temporal-subtraction images, image feature extraction of candidates of interval changes, rule-based tests by use of 16 image features for removing some false positives, and display of the computer output for identified interval changes. One hundred seven gold standard interval changes included 71 hot lesions (uptake was increased compared with the previous scan, or there was new uptake in the current scan) and 36 cold lesions (uptake was decreased or disappeared) for anterior and posterior views. The overall sensitivity in the detection of interval changes, including both hot and cold lesions evaluated by use of the resubstitution and the leave-one-case-out methods, were 95.3%, with 5.97 false positives per view, and 83.2% with 6.02, respectively. The temporal subtraction image for successive whole-body bone scans has the potential to enhance the interval changes between two images, which also can be quantified. Furthermore, the CAD scheme for the detection of interval changes by use of temporal subtraction images would be useful in assisting radiologists' interpretation on successive bone scan images.	2007
17271894	Nondestructive testing of the human breast: the validity of dynamic stress testing in medical infrared breast imaging.	The validity of the autonomic cold challenge for use in screening breast thermography is reviewed. A review of the literature is discussed along with reasoning for the choice of the cold stress method used. Breast thermogram results from 23 patients with histologically confirmed breast cancers are presented demonstrating positive and negative responses to the challenge. Cold challenge responses from 500 patients without breast cancer and with normal and persistent abnormal thermograms are also discussed. The question is posed, should the use of the cold challenge be continued considering that a negative response does not rule out the possibility of neoplasm nor does a positive response guarantee its existence? Conclusions are drawn from the available data that suggest that the use of the cold challenge be left up to the discretion of the interpreting thermologist and not mandated with every breast thermogram. Until further studies are performed and ample evidence can be presented, a review of the available data indicates that infrared imaging of the breast can be performed excluding the cold challenge without any known loss of sensitivity or specificity in the detection of breast cancers.	2004
17173312	In vivo brain edema classification: New insight offered by large b-value diffusion-weighted MR imaging.	To assess the role of large b-value diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) in the characterization of the physicochemical properties of the water in brain edema under experimental and clinical conditions.	Vasogenic brain edema was induced in mice by means of cold injury. A total of 17 patients with extensive peritumoral brain edema were also investigated. The longitudinal relaxation time (T(1)) and apparent diffusion coefficient (D) were measured in the edematous area both in humans and in mice. D was calculated by using both mono- (D(mono)) and biexponential (D(fast) and D(slow)) approaches in the low and overall range of b-values, respectively. The D values were correlated with the T(1) values.	A strong linear correlation was found between T(1) and D(mono) in vasogenic brain edema, both in humans and in mice. After breakdown of D(mono) into fast and slow diffusing components, only D(fast) exhibited a strong correlation with T(1); D(slow) was unchanged in vasogenic brain edema.	Large b-value DWI can furnish a detailed characterization of vasogenic brain edema, and may provide a quantitative approach for the differentiation of edema types on the basis of the physicochemical properties of the water molecules. Application of the DWI method may permit prediction and follow-up of the effects of antiedematous therapy.	2007
17142309	Novel patterns of genome rearrangement and their association with survival in breast cancer.	Representational Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis (ROMA) detects genomic amplifications and deletions with boundaries defined at a resolution of approximately 50 kb. We have used this technique to examine 243 breast tumors from two separate studies for which detailed clinical data were available. The very high resolution of this technology has enabled us to identify three characteristic patterns of genomic copy number variation in diploid tumors and to measure correlations with patient survival. One of these patterns is characterized by multiple closely spaced amplicons, or "firestorms," limited to single chromosome arms. These multiple amplifications are highly correlated with aggressive disease and poor survival even when the rest of the genome is relatively quiet. Analysis of a selected subset of clinical material suggests that a simple genomic calculation, based on the number and proximity of genomic alterations, correlates with life-table estimates of the probability of overall survival in patients with primary breast cancer. Based on this sample, we generate the working hypothesis that copy number profiling might provide information useful in making clinical decisions, especially regarding the use or not of systemic therapies (hormonal therapy, chemotherapy), in the management of operable primary breast cancer with ostensibly good prognosis, for example, small, node-negative, hormone-receptor-positive diploid cases.	2006
17133373	Quantitative protein analysis from formalin-fixed tissues: implications for translational clinical research and nanoscale molecular diagnosis.	Owing to its cross-linking effects, it is currently believed that formalin fixation of routinely processed tissues in the clinic prevents protein extraction and profiling. The aim of our study was to develop a robust, fast, standardized, and easy to use technique for the solubilization of non-degraded, full length, and immunoreactive proteins from formalin-fixed tissues for western blot and protein microarray analysis. Sections of routinely processed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissues of various origin were analysed. After deparaffination, tissues were manually dissected from the slides and transferred into an optimized protein extraction buffer system. Proteins were solubilized and subsequently analysed by western blot and reverse phase protein microarrays. We succeeded in isolating non-degraded, soluble, and immunoreactive proteins from routinely processed formalin-fixed tissues. We were able to detect membrane, cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins at the expected molecular weight. No differences were found in the protein yield and protein abundances between fresh frozen and formalin-fixed tissues. Using western blots and reverse phase protein microarrays, the receptor tyrosine kinase HER2, an important protein target for antibody based cancer treatment, was reliably measured in formalin-fixed breast cancer biopsy samples when compared with measurement by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization; remarkably, immunohistochemically equivocal cases (score 2+) can be categorized according to HER2 protein abundance. Our new clinically orientated multiplexed protein measurement system may be generally applicable to determine the relative abundances of known disease-related proteins in small amounts of routinely processed formalin-fixed tissue samples for research and diagnosis. This technique may also be used to identify, characterize, and validate known and new protein markers in a variety of human diseases.	2007
17131339	Prediction of metastasis from low-malignant breast cancer by gene expression profiling.	Promising results for prediction of outcome in breast cancer have been obtained by genome wide gene expression profiling. Some studies have suggested that an extensive overtreatment of breast cancer patients might be reduced by risk assessment with gene expression profiling. A patient group hardly examined in these studies is the low-risk patients for whom outcome is very difficult to predict with currently used methods. These patients do not receive adjuvant treatment according to the guidelines of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG). In this study, 26 tumors from low-risk patients were examined with gene expression profiling. An intermediate risk group of 34 low-malignant T2 tumors that fulfilled all other low-risk criteria than tumor size was included to increase statistical power. A 32-gene classifier, HUMAC32, was identified and it predicted metastases with 80% sensitivity and 77% specificity. The classifier was also validated in an independent group of high-risk tumors resulting in comparable performance of HUMAC32 and a 70-gene classifier developed for this group. Furthermore, the 70-gene signature was tested in our low- and intermediate-risk samples. The results demonstrated high cross-platform consistency of the classifiers. Higher performance of HUMAC32 was demonstrated among the low-malignant cancers compared with the 70-gene classifier. This suggests that although the metastatic potential to some extend is determined by the same genes in groups of tumors with different characteristics and risk, expression-based classification specifically developed in low-risk patients have higher predictive power in this group.	2007
17075113	Similar efficacy for ovarian ablation compared with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil: from a randomized comparison of premenopausal patients with node-positive, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.	To compare the efficacy of ovarian ablation versus chemotherapy in early breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-positive disease.	We conducted an open, randomized, multicenter trial including premenopausal breast cancer patients with hormone receptor-positive tumors and either axillary lymph node metastases or tumors with a size of 5 cm or more. Patients were randomly assigned to ovarian ablation by irradiation or to nine courses of chemotherapy with intravenous cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) administered every 3 weeks.	Between 1990 and May 1998, 762 patients were randomly assigned, and the present analysis is based on 358 first events. After a median follow-up time of 8.5 years, the unadjusted hazard ratio for disease-free survival in the ovarian ablation group compared with the CMF group was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.81 to 1.22). After a median follow-up time of 10.5 years, overall survival (OS) was similar in the two groups, with a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% CI, 0.88 to 1.42) for the ovarian ablation group compared with the CMF group.	In this study, ablation of ovarian function in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer had a similar effect to CMF on disease-free and OS. No significant interactions were demonstrated between treatment modality and hormone receptor content, age, or any of the well-known prognostic factors.	2006
17033039	Phase III trial comparing three doses of docetaxel for second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.	To evaluate whether a relationship exists between docetaxel dose and clinical response in the treatment of patients with advanced breast cancer.	Patients whose cancer had progressed after one prior chemotherapy regimen for advanced breast cancer or had recurred during or within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy were randomly assigned to docetaxel 60, 75, or 100 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks.	Five hundred twenty-seven patients were randomly assigned (intent to treat [ITT]), and 524 were assessable for toxicity. In the population assessable for efficacy (n = 407), logistic regression analysis showed that increasing docetaxel dose was significantly associated with higher response rate (P = .007) and improved time to progression (TTP; P = .014). In the ITT analysis, a significant dose-response relationship was observed for tumor response (P = .026) but not for TTP (P = .067). The incidences of most hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were related to increasing dose, with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurring in 76.4%, 83.7%, and 93.4% and febrile neutropenia occurring in 4.7%, 7.4%, and 14.1% of patients administered the 60, 75, and 100 mg/m2 doses, respectively. One death was considered treatment related.	A relationship between increasing dose of docetaxel and increased tumor response was observed across the dose range of 60 to 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Toxicities were related to increasing dose. Depending on the therapy goal, any of the doses studied may be appropriate for second-line treatment of advanced breast cancer.	2006
17005179	Intravenous paclitaxel administration in the rat induces a peripheral sensory neuropathy characterized by macrophage infiltration and injury to sensory neurons and their supporting cells.	Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (PN) can be a significant problem for patients receiving chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of breast, ovarian, and lung cancer as PN can influence the quality of life and survivorship in these patients. To begin to understand the cellular changes that occur within the peripheral and central nervous system as PN develops, we intravenously infused rats with clinically relevant doses of paclitaxel. Ten days later, behavioral changes indicative of PN became evident that included mechanical allodynia, cold hyperalgesia, and deficits in ambulation/coordination. These behaviors were accompanied by increased expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3; a marker of cellular injury) in a population of large>medium>small diameter sensory neurons, a population of satellite cells in the lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and in myelinating Schwann cells in the sciatic nerve. In addition, there was an increase in the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in DRG satellite cells and an increase in the number of CD68 positive activated macrophages within the DRG and peripheral nerve. Within lamina III-IV of the lumbar spinal cord, there was an increase in OX42 positive microglia. These data suggest that intravenous infusion of paclitaxel induces a peripheral neuropathy characterized by injury of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the peripheral nervous system, macrophage activation in both the DRG and peripheral nerve, and microglial activation within the spinal cord. An understanding of the factors involved in the development and maintenance of PN may lead to mechanism based therapies that prevent/treat PN and thus improve the survival and quality of life of patients receiving chemotherapy.	2007
16954431	Enhancement of sodium/iodide symporter expression in thyroid and breast cancer.	The sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) mediates iodide uptake in the thyroid gland and lactating breast. NIS mRNA and protein expression are detected in most thyroid cancer specimens, although functional iodide uptake is usually reduced resulting in the characteristic finding of a 'cold' or non-functioning lesion on a radioiodine image. Iodide uptake after thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulation, however, is sufficient in most differentiated thyroid cancer to utilize beta-emitting radioactive iodide for the treatment of residual and metastatic disease. Elevated serum TSH, achieved by thyroid hormone withdrawal in athyreotic patients or after recombinant human thyrotropin administration, directly stimulates NIS gene expression and/or NIS trafficking to the plasma membrane, increasing radioiodide uptake. Approximately 10-20% differentiated thyroid cancers, however, do not express the NIS gene despite TSH stimulation. These tumors are generally associated with a poor prognosis. Reduced NIS gene expression in thyroid cancer is likely due in part, to impaired trans-activation at the proximal promoter and/or the upstream enhancer. Basal NIS gene expression is detected in about 80% breast cancer specimens, but the fraction with functional iodide transport is relatively low. Lactogenic hormones and various nuclear hormone receptor ligands increase iodide uptake in breast cancer cells in vitro, but TSH has no effect. A wide range of 'differentiation' agents have been utilized to stimulate NIS expression in thyroid and breast cancer using in vitro and in vivo models, and a few have been used in clinical studies. Retinoic acid has been used to stimulate NIS expression in both thyroid and breast cancer. There are similarities and differences in NIS gene regulation and expression in thyroid and breast cancer. The various agents used to enhance NIS expression in thyroid and breast cancer will be reviewed with a focus on the mechanism of action. Agents that promote tumor differentiation, or directly stimulate NIS gene expression, may result in iodine concentration in 'scan-negative' thyroid cancer and some breast cancer.	2006
16869774	Induction of complete regressions of oncogene-induced breast tumors in mice.	Over the past decade, mouse models of cancer have come to resemble human disease much more closely than simple subcutaneous or orthotopic systems. Intervention strategies that work on these new model systems are more likely to have an impact clinically. We have shown recently that antiangiogenic stress imposed by loss of Id protein in endothelial progenitor cells results in dramatic central necrosis in breast tumors initiated in mice by overexpression of the her2/neu oncogene. Tumor cells remain viable at the periphery, perhaps via the hypoxic response pathway which allows the lesions to expand. Inhibition of this pathway by the inactivation of the Hif-1alpha chaperone Hsp90 in combination with antiangiogenic stress leads to the first reported complete regression of these aggressive breast tumors.	2005
16869771	Microenvironmental regulators of tissue structure and function also regulate tumor induction and progression: the role of extracellular matrix and its degrading enzymes.	It is now widely accepted that elements of the cellular and tissue microenvironment are crucial regulators of cell behavior in culture and homeostasis in vivo, and that many of the same factors influence the course of tumor progression. Less well established is the extent to which extracellular factors actually cause cancer, and the circumstances under which this may occur. Using physiologically relevant three-dimensional culture assays and transgenic animals, we have explored how the environmental and architectural context of cells, tissues, and organs controls mammary-specific gene expression, growth regulation, apoptosis, and drug resistance and have found that loss of tissue structure is a prerequisite for cancer progression. Here we summarize this evidence and highlight two of our recent studies. Using mouse mammary epithelial cells, we show that exposure to matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) stimulates production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that destabilize the genome and induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition, causing malignant transformation. Using a human breast cancer progression series, we find that ADAM-dependent growth factor shedding plays a crucial role in acquisition of the malignant phenotype. These findings illustrate how normal tissue structure controls the response to extracellular signals so as to preserve tissue specificity and growth status.	2005
16869768	Genetic and epigenetic changes in mammary epithelial cells identify a subpopulation of cells involved in early carcinogenesis.	Morphologically normal foci of epithelial cells exhibiting p16 inactivation have been found in several tissues and may be precursors to cancer. Our previous work demonstrates that cells lacking p16(INK4A) activity exhibit phenotypes associated with malignancy (Romanov et al. 2001). The acquisition of genomic instability occurs through the activation of telomeric and centrosomal dysfunction. Additionally, the activation of stress pathways such as COX-2 provides these cells with the mutagenic potential to survive adverse environments as well as the ability to migrate, evade apoptosis and immune surveillance, and summon sustaining vasculature. Examination of archived tissue from women with DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) reveals epithelial cells that overexpress markers of premalignant stress activation pathways and mirror the distinctive expression patterns of these markers observed in vitro. These epithelial cells are found within the premalignant lesion as well as in the field of morphologically normal tissue that surrounds the lesion. Here, we show that p16(INK4A)-silenced vHMEC cells exhibit a gene expression profile which is distinct, reproducible, and extends beyond the changes mediated by p16(INK4A) inactivation. The present work suggests that cells lacking p16(INK4A) activity exhibit critical activities which allow cells to evade differentiation processes that would be expected to terminate proliferation. All of these properties are critical to malignancy. These events may be useful biomarkers to detect the earliest events in breast cancer.	2005
16869750	The SRC substrate Tks5, podosomes (invadopodia), and cancer cell invasion.	Some years ago, we employed a screen of phage cDNA expression libraries to identify novel substrates of the protein tyrosine kinase Src. One of these, Tks5 (previously known as Fish), is a large scaffolding protein with an amino-terminal PX domain and five SH3 domains. In normal fibroblasts, Tks5 is cytoplasmic, but the protein is found in podosomes when the cells are transformed with Src. Using short interfering RNA technology, we have shown that Tks5 is required for podosome formation. Furthermore, cells with reduced Tks5 expression are poorly invasive through Matrigel. Tks5 is expressed and localized to podosomes in invasive human cancer cell lines and in tumor tissue, particularly breast cancers and melanomas. In these cells too, Tks5 is required for invasion. Our future work will focus on the identification of the binding partners of Tks5 that are responsible for podosome formation and invasion, and on determining the role of Tks5 in animal models of metastasis.	2005
16869748	Identifying site-specific metastasis genes and functions.	Metastasis is a multistep and multifunctional biological cascade that is the final and most life-threatening stage of cancer progression. Understanding the biological underpinnings of this complex process is of extreme clinical relevance and requires unbiased and comprehensive biological scrutiny. In recent years, we have utilized a xenograft model of breast cancer metastasis to discover genes that mediate organ-specific patterns of metastatic colonization. Examination of transcriptomic data from cohorts of primary breast cancers revealed a subset of site-specific metastasis genes that are selected for early in tumor progression. High expression of these genes predicts the propensity for lung metastasis independently of several classic markers of poor prognosis. These genes fulfill dual functions-enhanced primary tumorigenicity and augmented organ-specific metastatic activity. Other metastasis genes fulfill functions specialized for the microenvironment of the metastatic site and are consequently not selected for in primary tumors. These findings improve our understanding of metastatic progression, facilitate the interpretation of primary tumor gene expression data, and open several important possibilities for future clinical application.	2005
16869747	Exploiting the DNA repair defect in BRCA mutant cells in the design of new therapeutic strategies for cancer.	Individuals harboring germ-line mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are at highly elevated risk of a variety of cancers. Ten years of research has revealed roles for BRCA1 and BRCA2 in a wide variety of cellular processes. However, it seems likely that the function of these proteins in DNA repair is critically important in maintaining genome stability. Despite this increasing knowledge of the defects present in BRCA-deficient cells, BRCA mutation carriers developing cancer are still treated similarly to sporadic cases. Here we describe our efforts, based on understanding the DNA repair defects in BRCAdeficient cells, to define the optimal existing treatment for cancers arising in BRCA mutation carriers and, additionally, the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Finally, we discuss how therapies developed to treat BRCA mutant tumors might be applied to some sporadic cancers sharing similar specific defects in DNA repair.	2005
16869742	Abnormalities of the inactive X chromosome are a common feature of BRCA1 mutant and sporadic basal-like breast cancer.	As a clinical entity, breast cancer appears to be a series of subforms, each with a relatively specific molecular phenotype. Among the characteristics that differentiate these subforms are sex hormone receptor expression, HER2 expression, p53 mutation, high-grade histopathology, and particular gene expression array patterns. Sporadic basal-like breast cancer is one such form. It is a relatively common, high-grade, hormone receptor and HER2-expression-negative, p53 mutation-bearing tumor and is particularly lethal. Although wild type for BRCA1, it is a sporadic phenocopy of most cases of BRCA1(/) breast cancer. Not only do the cells of the two tumors resemble one another with respect to the above-noted characteristics, they also share a defect in the maintenance of an intact, inactive X chromosome (Xi). Other high-grade and most low-grade tumors are rarely defective at Xi. This evidence suggests that an Xi defect contributes to the evolution of both sporadic and BRCA1(/) basal-like breast tumors.	2005
16869738	High-resolution ROMA CGH and FISH analysis of aneuploid and diploid breast tumors.	Combining representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis (ROMA) of tumor DNA with fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) of individual tumor cells provides the opportunity to detect and validate a wide range of amplifications, deletions, and rearrangements directly in frozen tumor samples. We have used these combined techniques to examine 101 aneuploid and diploid breast tumors for which long-term follow-up and detailed clinical information were available. We have determined that ROMA provides accurate and sensitive detection of duplications, amplifications, and deletions and yields defined boundaries for these events with a resolution of <50 kbp in most cases. We find that diploid tumors exhibit fewer rearrangements on average than aneuploids, but rearrangements occur at the same locations in both types. Diploid tumors reflect at least three consistent patterns of rearrangement. The reproducibility and frequency of these events, especially in very early stage tumors, provide insight into the earliest chromosomal events in breast cancer. We have also identified correlations between certain sets of rearrangement events and clinically relevant parameters such as long-term survival. These correlations may enable novel prognostic indicators for breast and other cancers as more samples are analyzed.	2005
16869737	Somatic mutations in human cancer: insights from resequencing the protein kinase gene family.	All cancers arise due to the accumulation of mutations in critical target genes that, when altered, give rise to selective advantage in the cell and its progeny that harbor them. Knowledge of these mutations is key in understanding the biology of cancer initiation and progression, as well as the development of more targeted therapeutic strategies. We have undertaken a systematic screen of all annotated protein kinases in the human genome for mutations in a series of cancers including breast, non-small-cell lung, and testicular cancer. Our results show a wide diversity in mutation prevalence within and between tumor types. We have identified a mutator phenotype in human breast previously undescribed. The results presented from sequencing the same 1.3 million base pairs through several tumor types suggest that most of the observed mutations are likely to be passenger events rather than causally implicated in oncogenesis. However, this work does provide evidence for the likely existence of multiple, infrequently mutated kinases.	2005
16869736	Polygenic inherited predisposition to breast cancer.	The known breast cancer predisposing genes account for only about 20% of inherited susceptibility. Epidemiological analyses suggest that much of the remaining 80% is explained by the combined effect of many individually weak genetic variants, rather than by further rare, highly penetrant mutations. In the near term, identification of variants may indicate new pathways or mechanisms in breast cancer development. The polygenic model implies a wide distribution of risk in the population. In the longer term, it may be possible to construct individual risk profiles to guide public health interventions. The search for genetic variants has so far proved difficult. A key unanswered question is the "genetic architecture" of predisposition-that is, strong or weak alleles, common or rare. We describe a genome-wide scan designed to provide a first-pass answer to this question.	2005
16855427	"Cold" vertebrae on F-18 FDG PET: Causes and characteristics.	Photon deficiency in the vertebrae on FDG PET can arise as a result of varying etiologies, and a proper interpretation of this incidental observation is essential for an accurate diagnosis.	Cases with "cold" vertebrae on FDG PET resulting from different causes were selected and analyzed from a population of patients with cancer who underwent conventional whole-body FDG PET for staging, disease viability assessment, or treatment monitoring purposes. The patterns were studied and correlated with the appropriate clinical setting.	Three distinct causes were observed. Postexternal radiotherapy photopenia involving multiple vertebrae corresponding to the radiotherapy portals represented the most common setting for such findings followed by the destruction of the vertebral marrow cavity in the center by metastatic tumor cells. The third situation was vertebral hemangioma, in which relative photon deficiency in the concerned vertebra was incidentally observed amid generalized marrow uptake after colony-stimulating factor therapy. The characteristics and features of "cold" vertebrae in prototype cases selected from each etiology are described with illustrations.	Pattern recognition coupled with further correlation of this observation is the key to the correct diagnosis of the underlying etiology, which can at times have a bearing on subsequent management. With the growing use of FDG PET, this observation is likely to be encountered with increasing frequencies and possibly newer etiopathologies.	2006
16783613	Travel distance and season of diagnosis affect treatment choices for women with early-stage breast cancer in a predominantly rural population (United States).	Current standards of care for early-stage breast cancer include either breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with post-operative radiation or mastectomy. A variety of factors influence the type of treatment chosen. In northern, rural areas, daily travel for radiation can be difficult in winter. We investigated whether proximity to a radiation treatment facility (RTF) and season of diagnosis affected treatment choice for New Hampshire women with early-stage breast cancer.	Using a population-based cancer registry, we identified all women residents of New Hampshire diagnosed with stage I or II breast cancer during 1998-2000. We assessed factors influencing treatment choices using multivariate logistic regression.	New Hampshire women with early-stage breast cancer were less likely to choose BCS if they live further from a RTF (P < 0.001). Of those electing BCS, radiation was less likely to be used by women living >20 miles from a RTF (P = 0.002) and those whose diagnosis was made during winter (P = 0.031).	Our findings indicate that a substantial fraction of women with early-stage breast cancer in New Hampshire receive suboptimal treatment by forgoing radiation because of the difficulty traveling for radiation in winter. Future treatment planning strategies should consider these barriers to care in cold rural regions.	2006
16740623	PROBER: oligonucleotide FISH probe design software.	PROBER is an oligonucleotide primer design software application that designs multiple primer pairs for generating PCR probes useful for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). PROBER generates Tiling Oligonucleotide Probes (TOPs) by masking repetitive genomic sequences and delineating essentially unique regions that can be amplified to yield small (100-2000 bp) DNA probes that in aggregate will generate a single, strong fluorescent signal for regions as small as a single gene. TOPs are an alternative to bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) that are commonly used for FISH but may be unstable, unavailable, chimeric, or non-specific to small (10-100 kb) genomic regions. PROBER can be applied to any genomic locus, with the limitation that the locus must contain at least 10 kb of essentially unique blocks. To test the software, we designed a number of probes for genomic amplifications and hemizygous deletions that were initially detected by Representational Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis of breast cancer tumors.	http://prober.cshl.edu	2006
16707444	Controlled activation of ErbB1/ErbB2 heterodimers promote invasion of three-dimensional organized epithelia in an ErbB1-dependent manner: implications for progression of ErbB2-overexpressing tumors.	Receptor tyrosine kinases of the ErbB family are implicated in a number of cancers, including that of the breast. ErbB receptors are activated by ligand-induced formation of homodimers and heterodimers. Receptor heterodimerization is thought to play a critical role in breast cancers overexpressing multiple members of the ErbB family. Although coexpression of ErbB receptors is associated with poor patient prognosis, the mechanisms by which receptor heterodimerization regulates tumor progression are not clear, due in part to a lack of methods that allow controlled activation of specific receptor heterodimers in mammary epithelial cells. Here, we report an approach to activate ErbB1-ErbB2 heterodimers in a nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, without interference from endogenous ErbB receptors. Using such a method, we show that whereas both ErbB2 homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB2 heterodimers were equally potent in activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the heterodimers were more potent in activating the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase Cgamma1 pathways than ErbB2 homodimers. We combined the dimerization system with a three-dimensional cell culture approach to show that whereas both ErbB2 homodimers and ErbB1-ErbB2 heterodimers induced disruption of three-dimensional acini-like structures, only heterodimers promoted invasion of cells through extracellular matrix. The ability of heterodimers to induce invasion required the ErbB1 kinase activity and required activation of PI3K, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phospholipase Cgamma1 signaling pathways. Thus, we have identified cell invasion as a heterodimer-specific biological outcome and suggest that coexpression of ErbB1 may critically regulate invasive progression of ErbB2-positive breast cancers.	2006
16631082	In vitro cytotoxicity of 211At-labeled trastuzumab in human breast cancer cell lines: effect of specific activity and HER2 receptor heterogeneity on survival fraction.	Radioimmunotherapy with anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as trastuzumab is a promising strategy for treating HER2-positive breast and ovarian carcinoma patients. The objective of this study was to determine the cytotoxic effectiveness of trastuzumab labeled with the 7.2-h half-life alpha-particle emitter 211At.	Experiments were performed on SKBr-3, BT-474 and the transfected MCF7/HER2-18 human breast carcinoma cell lines. Intrinsic radiosensitivity was determined after exposure to external beam irradiation. The cytotoxicity of 211At-labeled trastuzumab was measured by clonogenic assays. The distribution of HER2 receptor expression on the cell lines was measured using fluorescence-activated cell sorting. A pharmacokinetic (PK)/microdosimetric model was established to assess the effects of specific activity (SA), HER2 receptor expression and absorbed dose on survival fraction (SF).	With external beam irradiation, the 2-Gy SF for BT-474, SKBr-3 and MCF7/HER2-18 cells was 0.78, 0.53 and 0.64 Gy, respectively. Heterogeneous HER2 expression was observed, with a subpopulation of cells lacking measurable receptor (14.5%, SKBr-3; 0.34%, MCF-7/HER2; 1.73%, BT-474). When plotted as a function of activity concentration, SF curves were biphasic and inversely proportional to SA; however, when the model was applied and absorbed doses calculated, the SF curve was monoexponential independent of SA. Thus, the PK model was able to demonstrate the effects of competition between cold and labeled mAb. These studies showed that the relative biological effectiveness of 211At-labeled trastuzaumab was about 10 times higher than that of external beam therapy.	These in vitro studies showed that 211At-labeled trastuzumab mAb is an effective cytotoxic agent for the treatment of HER2-positive tumor cells. The SA of the labeled mAb and the homogeneity of HER2 receptor expression are important variables influencing the efficiency of cell killing.	2006
16627201	PET and planar imaging of tumor hypoxia with labeled metronidazole.	This study was aimed to develop 99mTc- and 68Ga-labeled metronidazole (MN) using ethylenedicysteine (EC) as a chelator and evaluate their potential use to assess tumor hypoxia.	EC-MN was labeled with 99mTc in the presence of tin (II) chloride. Labeling EC-MN with 68Ga was achieved by adding 68GaCl3 (2 mCi with 3.4 microg cold GaCl3). In vitro cellular uptakes of 99mTc- and 68Ga-EC-MN were obtained in various types of tumor cells at 0.5-4 hours. Tissue distribution and PET imaging of 99mTc and 68Ga-EC-MN were evaluated in breast tumor-bearing rats at 0.5-4 hours. Tumor oxygen tension was measured using an oxygen probe.	There were similar cellular uptakes (2-10%) between 99mTc- and 68Ga-EC-MN at 0.5-4 hours. In vivo biodistribution of 99mTc- and 68Ga-EC-MN in breast tumor-bearing rats showed increased tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle count density ratios as a function of time. Positron emission tomography images confirmed that the tumors could be visualized clearly with 68Ga-EC-MN. Oxygen tension in tumor tissue was determined to be 6-10 mm Hg compared with 40-50 mm Hg in normal muscle tissue.	The results indicated that it is feasible to use 99mTc- and 68Ga-EC-MN for assessment of tumor hypoxia. These agents may be useful in selecting and evaluating cancer therapy.	2006
16615912	Crystal structure of the HP1-EMSY complex reveals an unusual mode of HP1 binding.	Heterochromatin protein-1 (HP1) plays an essential role in both the assembly of higher-order chromatin structure and epigenetic inheritance. The C-terminal chromo shadow domain (CSD) of HP1 is responsible for homodimerization and interaction with a number of chromatin-associated nonhistone proteins, including EMSY, which is a BRCA2-interacting protein that has been implicated in the development of breast and ovarian cancer. We have determined the crystal structure of the HP1beta CSD in complex with the N-terminal domain of EMSY at 1.8 A resolution. Surprisingly, the structure reveals that EMSY is bound by two HP1 CSD homodimers, and the binding sequences differ from the consensus HP1 binding motif PXVXL. This structural information expands our understanding of HP1 binding specificity and provides insights into interactions between HP1 homodimers that are likely to be important for heterochromatin formation.	2006
16292882	The molecular analysis of breast cancer utilizing targeted nanoparticle based ultrasound contrast agents.	This study was structured to challenge the hypothesis that nano-sized particulates could be molecularly targeted and bound to the prognostic and predictive HER-2/neu cell membrane receptor to elicit detectable changes in ultrasound response from human breast cancer cells. SKBR-3 human breast cancer cells were enlisted to test the efficacy of the particle conjugation strategy used in this study and ultimately, to provide conclusive remarks regarding the validity of the stated hypothesis. A characterization-mode ultrasound (CMUS) system was used to apply a continuum mechanics based, two-step inversion algorithm to reconstruct the mechanical material properties of four cell/agarose test conditions upon three independent test samples. The four test conditions include: Herceptin conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles bound to cells (HER-con), Herceptin bound to cells (HER), iso-type matched antibody conjugated iron oxide nanoparticles bound to cells (ISO-con), and Cold Flow Buffer mixed with agarose (CFB). The statistical analysis of these ultrasound results supported the ability to differentiate between HER-2/neu positive SKBR-3 cells that have been successfully tagged with Herceptin(R) conjugated iron oxide particles to those that have not demonstrated particle binding. These findings serve as promising proof-of-concept data for the development of a quantitative histopathologic evaluation tool directed towards both in situ and in vivo applications. The ultimate goal of this research is to exploit the molecular expression of the HER-2/neu protein to offer rapid, quantitative ultrasound information concerning the malignancy rating of human breast tissue employing tumor targeting nanoparticle based ultrasound contrast agents. When fully developed, this could potentially help 32,000-63,000 women efficiently find their proper treatment strategy to fight and win their battle against breast cancer.	2005
16193394	The effect of height on paclitaxel nerve damage.	Dying-back neuropathies result in sensory loss and motor signs in the distal distribution of the longest nerves of the body. It would be expected, therefore, that taller individuals with dying-back neuropathies would tend to have worse nerve damage than shorter individuals. This hypothesis was tested in patients receiving high dose paclitaxel. Nerve conductions and quantitative sensory tests were obtained in 21 breast cancer subjects, prior to and 20-40 days after 725 mg/m(2) paclitaxel administered intravenously over 24 h. Despite the uniform dose of paclitaxel, there was a wide variation in post minus pre-paclitaxel changes. Analysis by linear regression showed that decrease of peroneal nerve compound muscle action potential amplitude was significantly greater in taller subjects (P=0.004), and increase in cold detection threshold was greater in taller subjects (P=0.02). No correlation with height was found for paclitaxel drug clearance, maximum concentration, and area under the curve. Decrease in sural sensory nerve action potential amplitude and increase in vibration detection threshold did not correlate with height. In summary, the wide variation of changes seen in neurophysiological tests suggests that multiple factors are involved in determining the severity of neuropathy. Nerve length is probably one of these factors. To determine whether the effect of height is clinically important would require additional study with a larger number of subjects and longer clinical follow-up.	2005
16188440	Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia due to docetaxel-capecitabine therapy is treated with vitamin E without dose reduction.	Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) is a distinctive and relatively frequent toxic reaction related to some chemotherapeutic agents. Doxorubicin, cytarabine, docetaxel, fluorouracil, and capecitabine are the most frequently implicated agents. Recently, taxanes, especially docetaxel, have been widely used in combination with capecitabine in patients with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). A high percentage of PPE has been seen in patients undergoing this combination therapy. PPE seems to be dose dependent and both peak drug concentration and total cumulative dose determine its occurrence. Withdrawal or dose reduction of the implicated drug usually gives rise to amelioration of the symptoms. Supportive treatments such as topical wound care, elevation, and cold compresses may help to relieve the pain. Use of systemic corticosteroids, pyridoxine (vitamin B6), blood flow reduction, and, recently, topical 99% dimethyl-sulfoxide have been used with variable outcomes. Vitamin E treatment has not been published before, especially without dose reduction of docetaxel-capecitabine therapy. Here we present five MBC patients treated with docetaxel-capecitabine combination therapy in whom PPE was observed during the clinical follow-up period. In all patients grade 2-3 PPE was observed. Vitamin E therapy was started at 300 mg/day p.o. without dose reduction of therapy and after 1 week of treatment PPE began to disappear. We suggest that it could be of interest to consider vitamin E as a preventive drug when drugs with a strong association with PPE are going to be administered.	2006
16173788	Combined radioimmunotherapy and chemotherapy of breast tumors with Y-90-labeled anti-Her2 and anti-CEA antibodies with taxol.	Because breast cancer cells often express either Her2/neu or carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) or both, these tumor markers are good targets for radioimmunotherapy using Y-90-labeled antibodies. We performed studies on nude mice bearing xenografts from MCF7, a cell line that has low Her2 and CEA expression, to more accurately reflect the more usual situation in breast cancer. Although uptake of In-111 anti-CEA into tumors was lower than that for In-111-labeled anti-Her2, radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with Y-90 anti-CEA was equivalent to that of Y-90 anti-Her2. When either Y-90 antibody was combined with a split-dose treatment with Taxol, the antitumor effect was greater than with either agent alone. When Y-90 anti-CEA was combined with a single dose of Taxol, the results were equivalent to the split-dose regimen. RIT plus cold Herceptin had no additional effects on tumor size reduction over RIT alone. When animals were first treated with Y-90 anti-Her2 and imaged 1-2 weeks later with In-111 anti-CEA or anti-Her2, tumor uptake was higher for anti-CEA and improved over tumor uptake with no prior RIT. These results suggest that a split dose of RIT with anti-Her2 antibody followed by anti-CEA antibody would be more effective than a single dose of either. This prediction was partially confirmed in a controlled study comparing single- vs split-dose anti-Her2 RIT followed by either anti-Her2 or anti-CEA RIT. These studies suggest that combined RIT and Taxol therapy are suitable in breast cancers expressing either low amounts of Her2 or CEA, thus expanding the number of eligible patients for combined therapies. They further suggest that split-dose RIT using different combinations of Y-90-labeled antibodies is effective in antitumor therapy.
16144761	The effect of block copolymer structure on the internalization of polymeric micelles by human breast cancer cells.	The objective of this study was to assess the effect of hydrophilic/hydrophobic block chain lengths on the internalization of poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) micelles by cancer cells. PEO-b-PCL block copolymers with varied PEO and PCL chain lengths were synthesized, assembled to polymeric micelles and loaded with a hydrophobic fluorescent probe (DiI) through a co-solvent evaporation method of physical encapsulation. The slow release of the fluorescent probe from the micellar structure was evidenced following DiI transfer to lipid vesicles. The extent of micellar uptake by cancer cells was investigated through their incubation with MCF-7 cells followed by measurement of the fluorescent emission intensity of DiI (lambda=550 nm) in separated lysed cells. Cellular internalization of polymeric micelles was confirmed by laser scanning microscopy. The mechanism of micellar uptake was investigated by pretreatment of MCF-7 cells with chlorpromazine and cytochalasin B. Encapsulation of DiI in PEO-b-PCL micelles lowered the extent and rate of hydrophobic probe internalization by cancer cells. For polymeric micelles with 5000 gmol(-1) of PCL and varied PEO molecular weights of 2000, 5000 and 13,000 gmol(-1), maximum uptake was observed at a PEO molecular weight of 5000 gmol(-1). For polymeric micelles with 5000 gmol(-1) of PEO and varied PCL molecular weights of 5000, 13,000 and 24,000 gmol(-1), maximum uptake was observed at 13,000 gmol(-1) of PCL. Chlorpromazine reduced the cellular uptake of PEO-b-PCL micelles independent from the block copolymer structure, pointing to the involvement of clathrin mediated endocytosis mechanisms in the uptake of polymeric micelles by cancer cells. Inhibition of cellular uptake of PEO-b-PCL micelles by cytochalasin B, on the other hand, was found to be dependent on the chemical structure of the core/shell forming blocks.	2005
16142251	Monoclonal antibodies: old and new trends in breast cancer imaging and therapeutic approach.	Over the last two decades, various research protocols were applied for scintigraphic imaging, prognosis and treatment of breast cancer, using monoclonal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and B72.3, prepared against the tumour-associated glycoprotein, TAG-72. The recombinant humanized "cold" anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab), which targets oncogene receptor HER2 has hitherto been the only monoclonal antibody widely used for the treatment of breast cancer in the USA, with or without chemotherapy. Trastuzumab is constructed against the HER2 oncogene receptor (also known as neu or c-erb-B2), which is overexpressed in 25%-30% of breast cancer cell lines and is associated with poor prognosis. Immuno-lymphoscintigraphy is also applied to guide and monitor the effect of treatment regimes. Radiolabelled, "hot" monoclonal antibodies are currently being applied for the treatment of primary or metastatic breast cancer, in experimental, pre-clinical, or clinical trials, in combination with traditional external beam radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Radioimmunotherapy comprises systemically administered monoclonal antibodies, linked to high-energy, beta-emitting radionuclides. Radioactive antibodies, in the form of yttrium-90 (90Y)-BrE-3, 90Y- m170 and 131I- or 90Y- labelled L6 antibody, are applied with adjuvant autologous peripheral blood stem cells transfusion, to prevent myelotoxicity. Partial or rarely complete responses to "hot" antibody treatment, of breast cancer have been reported. Innovative strategies using this combined-modality treatment hold promise for better disease-free and survival rates.
16136052	Does timing of adjuvant chemotherapy influence the prognosis after early breast cancer? Results of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG).	The purpose of this study was to examine the effect on survival of delaying the start of adjuvant chemotherapy for early breast cancer for up to 3 months after surgery. In the nation-wide clinical trials of the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group, 7501 breast cancer patients received chemotherapy within 3 months of surgery between 1977 and 1999: 352 with classical cyclofosfamide, metotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF); 6065 with CMF i.v. and 1084 with cyclofosfamide, epirubicin and 5-fluorouracil. For the analysis, the time between surgery and the start of chemotherapy was divided into four strata (1-3, 4, 5 and 6-13 weeks). The results show that within the three groups of chemotherapy, there was an even distribution of known prognostic factors across the four strata of initiation of chemotherapy. There was no pattern indicating a benefit from early start of chemotherapy. No significant interactions were found for subgroups of patients with a poorer prognosis (many involved lymph nodes, high-grade malignancies or hormone receptor negative disease). In conclusion, we have found no evidence for a survival benefit due to early initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy within the first 2-3 months after surgery.	2005
16003554	Metastatic disease of bronchial carcinoma in a thyroid nodule: a case report.	Metastatic spread of solid tumors to the thyroid is a rare finding in patients with thyroid nodules. The most frequent sites of the primary tumor include the kidney, breast and lung. Work up of patients with a cold thyroid nodule and a history of cancer should therefore rule out other metastasizing cancer or recurrence of the previous tumor using fine-needle aspiration of the thyroid mass. We report the case of a 64-year-old male with metastatic spread of a bronchial carcinoma to the thyroid and the management of this case.	2005
15915448	Serum protein profiling by miniaturized solid-phase extraction and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.	Serum profiling by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) holds promise as a clinical tool for early diagnosis of cancer and other human diseases. Sample preparation is key to achieving reproducible and well-resolved signals in MALDI-MS; a prerequisite for translation of MALDI-MS based diagnostic methods to clinical applications. We have investigated a number of MALDI matrices and several miniaturized solid-phase extraction (SPE) methods for serum protein concentration and desalting with the aim of generating reproducible, high-quality protein profiles by MALDI-MS. We developed a simple protocol for serum profiling that combines a matrix mixture of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid with miniaturized SPE and MALDI-MS. Functionalized membrane discs with hydrophobic, ion-exchange or chelating properties allowed reproducible MALDI mass spectra (m/z 1000-12,000) to be obtained from serum. In a proof-of-principle application, SPE with chelating material and MALDI-MS identified protein peaks in serum that had been previously reported for distinguishing a person diagnosed with breast cancer from a control. These preliminary results indicate that this simple SPE/MALDI-MS method for serum profiling provides a versatile and scalable platform for clinical proteomics.	2005
15868915	HER2-specific cytotoxic activity of lymphokine-activated killer cells in the presence of trastuzumab.	We investigated whether trastuzumab, a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, could induce HER2-specific cytotoxic activity on lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Trastuzumab alone was not toxic to the HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB453 and ZR75-1, nor to the HER2-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB468 and MCF-7. LAK cells, which were activated with 1000 U/ml IL-2 for 4 days (4-day LAK), showed cytotoxic activity against the MDA-MB453, ZR75-1 and MCF-7 cells, but not against MDA-MB468 cells. LAK cell cytotoxic activity against the HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB453 and ZR75-1 was significantly augmented in the presence of 10 nM trastuzumab, but that against the HER2-negative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB468 and MCF-7 was not. The cytotoxic activity of LAK cells plus trastuzumab against the MDA-MB453 cells was significantly inhibited by the addition of cold MDA-MB453 cells or cold ZR75-1 cells, but not by addition of cold MDA-MB468 cells. Twenty-nine percent of the 4-day LAK cells were CD16+, and the cytotoxicity of LAK cells plus trastuzumab was abrogated with the anti-CD16 antibody treatment of the LAK cells in the cytotoxicity assay. Only 7% of the 10-day LAK cells were CD16+, and the 10-day LAK cells failed to exhibit cytotoxicity even with trastuzumab. These results suggest that HER2-specific cytotoxic activity, which is mediated by an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) mechanism, can be induced on LAK cells by the addition of trastuzumab.
15809587	Sensory recovery in the sensate free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap.	Preservation and restoration of sensation to improve the quality of the reconstruction have not always been considered a priority in efforts to reconstruct the breast. Studies have documented spontaneous recovery of sensation in reconstructed breasts, but this recovery was variable and unpredictable. The authors conducted a pilot study to compare sensory recovery in innervated versus noninnervated microsurgical breast reconstruction patients.	The authors investigated a group of 14 patients who had undergone microsurgical breast reconstruction with a muscle-sparing free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap. Seven patients had reinnervation of their flaps, and seven did not. The two patient groups were similar in age (mean age, 46 years for the innervated group and 51 years for the noninnervated group) and length of follow-up (mean duration of follow-up, 39 months for the innervated group and 40 months for the noninnervated group). Sensitivity to fine touch was assessed using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. By testing over a defined grid and over the entire reconstructed breast, it was possible to develop color maps, or sensory topograms, of the areas sensing different levels of pressure for each patient. The patient's ability to differentiate between hot (60 degrees C) and cold (5 degrees C) was recorded.	In a comparison of sensation in flap skin (skin paddle of rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap) with nonflap skin (native breast skin), sensitivity to fine touch was statistically better in (1) innervated flap skin compared with noninnervated flap skin (p = 0.003), (2) innervated nonflap skin compared with noninnervated flap skin (p = 0.006), (3) innervated nonflap skin compared with noninnervated nonflap skin (p = 0.037), and (4) innervated flap skin compared with noninnervated nonflap skin (p = 0.006). Temperature differentiation was significantly better in patients with innervated flaps than in patients with noninnervated flaps in all zones (p = 0.02). These differences persisted beyond a follow-up period of 3 years.	The authors' findings confirm that reinnervation of microsurgically reconstructed breasts achieves sensory recovery that is superior to that in breasts reconstructed without reinnervation. If sensation is important and the anatomical factors are favorable, reinnervation may represent a worthwhile refinement in attempts to achieve normality for patients undergoing breast reconstruction.	2005
15806160	Akt phosphorylates the Y-box binding protein 1 at Ser102 located in the cold shock domain and affects the anchorage-independent growth of breast cancer cells.	Akt/PKB is a serine/threonine kinase that promotes tumor cell growth by phosphorylating transcription factors and cell cycle proteins. There is particular interest in finding tumor-specific substrates for Akt to understand how this protein functions in cancer and to provide new avenues for therapeutic targeting. Our laboratory sought to identify novel Akt substrates that are expressed in breast cancer. In this study, we determined that activated Akt is positively correlated with the protein expression of the transcription/translation factor Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) in primary breast cancer by screening tumor tissue microarrays. We therefore questioned whether Akt and YB-1 might be functionally linked. Herein, we illustrate that activated Akt binds to and phosphorylates the YB-1 cold shock domain at Ser102. We then addressed the functional significance of disrupting Ser102 by mutating it to Ala102. Following the stable expression of Flag:YB-1 and Flag:YB-1 (Ala102) in MCF-7 cells, we observed that disruption of the Akt phosphorylation site on YB-1 suppressed tumor cell growth in soft agar and in monolayer. This correlated with an inhibition of nuclear translocation by the YB-1(Ala102) mutant. In conclusion, YB-1 is a new Akt substrate and disruption of this specific site inhibits tumor cell growth.	2005
15786430	Cryoablation and cryolocalization in the management of breast disease.	Cryotechnology is currently used for both treatment and diagnosis of breast disease. Due to the natural analgesic effect of cold, cryoablation is potentially more patient-friendly than other technologies which raise tissue temperature. Freezing produces a predictable volume of necrosis and is easily observed and controlled during treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that, as a primary therapy for breast fibroadenoma, cryoablation is safe and effective with durable results that can be reproduced in community practices. Certain barriers do exist before cryoablation, or any other in situ ablation, can become a standard therapy for the treatment of localized breast malignancy. Investigations are underway to refine patient selection criteria and develop valid confirmatory assays so that clinical trials can begin. Cryolocalization, which creates a well-delineated, palpable mass of frozen tissue encompassing a tumor, is a relatively new application of cold in medicine. This strategy promises to reduce positive margin rates during lumpectomy of non- or barely-palpable tumors. Finally, cryotechnology now also aids in the collection of tissue for histological analysis.	2005
15770199	An improved internal mammary irradiation technique in radiation treatment of locally advanced breast cancers.	The purpose of the present study was to compare a new internal mammary irradiation technique with traditional techniques for locally advanced breast cancers in terms of sparing ipsilateral lung and heart and reducing the "cold" and "hot spots"in breast tissue. The new technique uses wide tangential fields for the first eight fractions of treatment. A medial internal mammary field (IMF) of electrons matched with narrowed tangential fields is used for the remaining fractions. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) by means of segmented multileaf collimation (SMLC) is used in the narrowed tangential fields to improve the match between the electron and the photon fields. Treatment planning was performed to compare this technique to a wide-tangential-only technique and to a traditional oblique IMF technique for three patients with differing habitus. Film dosimetry was performed in a solid water phantom to confirm the planning results. For all three patients, the mean doses of the ipsilateral lung and the heart were significantly reduced with the new technique. The lung and the heart volumes were remarkably reduced at lowdose levels (< or =12 Gy) compared to the traditional IMF technique, and significantly reduced at all dose levels compared to the wide tangential technique. The new technique also reduced the "cold" and "hot spots" along the match plane between the IMF and the tangential fields compared to the traditional IMF technique. In conclusion, the new IMF technique shows dosimetric improvement compared to the traditional IMF technique in terms of the critical organ sparing and target dose uniformity.	2005
15687613	In-situ ablation of breast cancer.	Recent trends in the management of early breast cancer have moved toward breast conservation, without a loss in disease-free intervals or overall survival. The in situ ablation of breast tumors without the need for lumpectomy is the next logical extension of this trend. Advances in stereotactic guided localization, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology has markedly improved our ability to visualize, biopsy and possibly treat breast tumors. With these technologies, probes for delivery of energy for ablating tumors and for monitoring the effect can be placed precisely within breast tumors. Several methods are available to destroy tumors in situ, based on thermal destruction of tumor with either heat or cold. Cryoablation is performed using a liquid-nitrogen cooled needle. Heating techniques include delivery of the heat through probes placed in the lesion to conduct radiofrequency irradiation or laser light energy. Two techniques, focused ultrasound and focused microwave thermotherapy, are truly non-invasive in that they do not involve any skin puncture. In addition to the incentive of eliminating lumpectomy from the treatment paradigm for early stage breast cancer, and the potential cosmetic advantages, in situ ablation may also provide an immunological benefit by providing a source of antigens for the development of a systemic anti-tumor immune response. The augmentation of this response may provide an advantage to in situ ablation in terms of recurrence and survival rates.	2001
15664365	Quantification of the bombesin/gastrin releasing peptide antagonist RC-3095 by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.	Bombesin (BN) and its mammalian equivalent, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), stimulate cell proliferation and are involved in the pathogenesis of several types of human cancer. BN/GRP and their receptors were shown to be critical for the growth of various human malignancies, such as small-cell lung, prostate, ovary, stomach and breast cancers in the human tumor xenograft model. In the present study, a fast, sensitive, robust method was developed for the determination and quantification of a BN/GRP receptor antagonist RC-3095 (D-Tpi-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Leupsi(CH2NH)Leu-NH2), in human plasma by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. RC-3095 was extracted from 0.2 ml human plasma by protein precipitation using cold acetonitrile (0.4 ml). The method has a chromatographic run of 10 min using a C(8) analytical column (150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d.) and the linear calibration curve over the range was linear from 20 to 10000 ng ml(-1) (r(2)>0.994). The between-run precision, based on the relative standard deviation replicate quality controls, was 5.7% (60 ng ml(-1)), 7.1% (600 ng ml(-1)) and 6.8% (8000 ng ml(-1)). The between-run accuracy was +/-0.0, 2.1 and 3.1% for the above-mentioned concentrations, respectively. The developed procedure allows the quantitative determination of peptide RC-3095 for pharmacokinetics studies in human plasma.	2005
15660258	[methyl-3H]Choline incorporation into MCF7 tumour cells: correlation with proliferation.	The aim of the study was to investigate the intracellular location of [methyl-(3)H]choline in MCF7 tumour cells and to determine the relationship between [methyl-(3)H]choline incorporation and proliferation.	Tumour cells were incubated with [methyl-(3)H]choline for 10 min, and then in cold medium to simulate the rapid blood clearance of [methyl-(11)C]choline. Labelled metabolites were then extracted from cells by treating them with organic and aqueous solvents to determine the distribution of tracer between phospholipid and water-soluble metabolite pools. Aqueous extracts were subjected to thin-layer chromatography, ion exchange chromatography and a choline extraction procedure to identify (3)H-containing metabolites. Procedures were carried out on fast- and slow-growing populations of MCF7 cells to determine the relationship between choline incorporation and proliferation.	Only about 5% of [methyl-(3)H]choline was present as phospholipid. [methyl-(3)H]choline incorporation was found to be related to S-phase fraction. In another experiment, [methyl-(14)C]choline incorporation was found to be correlated with [methyl-(3)H]thymidine incorporation. The V(max) of choline uptake was found to be increased whilst K(m) was decreased in populations of MCF7 cells with higher proliferative fractions, compared with populations having lower proliferative fractions.	Choline incorporation into tumour cells under conditions that simulate rapid blood clearance of [methyl-(11)C]choline is correlated with proliferation. Most of the activity (about 95%) was in the non-lipid fraction of the cell.	2005
15629541	Characterization of the [125I]endomorphin-2 binding sites in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line.	In the present study, the expression of the micro-opioid receptor on protein level has been demonstrated in MCF7 breast cancer cells. Binding of the [125I]-labeled micro-opioid receptor selective ligand endomorphin-2 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-Phe-NH2) was examined in vitro using a cross-linking assay followed by a Western blot technique. The radioactive complex had a molecular weight of about 65 kDa and was detectable by anti-micro-opioid receptor antibody, indicating the presence of micro-opioid receptors in MCF7 cell membranes. Characterization of endomorphin-2 binding to the membranes obtained from MCF7 cells was performed. Cold saturation experiments with [125I]endomorphin-2 showed biphasic binding curves in Scatchard coordinates. One component represents a high affinity and low capacity, and the other low affinity and higher capacity binding sites. The obtained Bmax values for [125I]endomorphin-2 binding to MCF7 membranes were much higher than those obtained for mouse brain. Pharmacological characterization of the [125I]endomorphin-2 binding sites was made using endomorphin-2 and two other micro selective ligands, morphiceptin, and [D-1-Nal3]morphiceptin on MCF7 cell membrane preparations and whole MCF7 cells. In both cases, the rank order of potency was [D-1-Nal3]morphiceptin>endomorphin-2>morphiceptin, but in case of whole MCF7 cells the IC50 values were about 40 times higher.	2005
15514369	Quality of life of postmenopausal women in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trial.	To determine the quality of life (QoL) of women participating in the Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Combination (ATAC) Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trial during the first 2 years of treatment.	A total of 1,021 women were enrolled onto the QoL subprotocol. All had completed primary treatment (surgery +/- radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy) and were to receive 5 years of adjuvant treatment with anastrozole (n = 335), tamoxifen (n = 347), or a combination (n = 339) of both. Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) plus endocrine subscale (ES) at baseline and 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, or until disease recurrence. The primary end point was the FACT-B Trial Outcome Index (TOI). The secondary end point was the ES total score. Analyses of individual endocrine symptoms were also explored.	Questionnaire completion approximated 85% of assessments available for analysis. Overall QoL for all groups improved from baseline during the 2-year period. There were no significant differences in TOI or ES scores across treatment groups. Endocrine symptoms increased between baseline and 3 months for all groups and stabilized thereafter. There were some small differences in side effect profiles. Compared with patients receiving tamoxifen only, patients receiving anastrozole only reported significantly fewer cold sweats and vaginal discharge, yet more vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, and loss of sexual interest.	Two years of treatment with anastrozole, tamoxifen, or the combination had a similar overall QoL impact, showing gradual improvement over time. Endocrine-related symptoms for all three arms worsened initially and recovered partially during 2 years. The different symptoms experienced may assist in decision making about treatment and supportive care needs.	2004

15179850	Effect of forced convection on the skin thermal expression of breast cancer.	A bioheat-transfer-based numerical model was utilized to study the energy balance in healthy and malignant breasts subjected to forced convection in a wind tunnel. Steady-state temperature distributions on the skin surface of the breasts were obtained by numerically solving the conjugate heat transfer problem. Parametric studies on the influences of the airflow on the skin thermal expression of tumors were performed. It was found that the presence of tumor may not be clearly shown due to the irregularities of the skin temperature distribution induced by the airflow field. Nevertheless, image subtraction techniques could be employed to eliminate the effects of the flow field and thermal noise and significantly improve the thermal signature of the tumor on the skin surface. Inclusion of the possible skin vascular response to cold stress caused by the airflow further enhances the signal, especially for deeply embedded tumors that otherwise may not be detectable.	2004
15157784	Theoretical analysis of unidirectional intercellular ice propagation in stratified cell clusters.	A recently published theoretical analysis of intercellular ice propagation in stratified cell clusters comprising concentric spherical layers, by Zhang, Xu, Sandison, and Zhang [Cryobiology 47 (2003) 143], has been examined and is shown to be flawed. New equations are derived subject to simplifying assumptions implicit in the theoretical model presented by Zhang and co-workers. The conclusion by Zhang and colleagues that intercellular ice propagation can be assumed to be instantaneous is demonstrated to be invalid.	2004
15069116	Breast cancer risk after caloric restriction during the 1944-1945 Dutch famine.	Data from animal models suggest that caloric restriction may reduce the risk of breast cancer, although not all dietary regimens produce similar effects. We examined whether caloric restriction imposed as a consequence of the 1944-1945 Dutch famine reduced the risk of breast cancer in women participating in a Dutch breast cancer screening program.	Between 1983 and 1986, approximately 15 000 women, aged 2 to 33 years during the 1944-1945 Dutch famine, responded to a questionnaire about their famine experience. A famine exposure score, graded as absent, moderate, or severe exposure, was derived from answers regarding hunger, cold, and weight loss. During follow-up until January 2000, 585 women with incident breast cancer were identified by the regional cancer registry. The relationship between famine exposure and breast cancer risk was assessed by weighted Cox regression models, in which person-years lived for the entire cohort was extrapolated from data from a random sample of 15% of the cohort.	Women who were severely exposed to the famine had a statistically significantly higher risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09 to 2.01) than women who were not exposed. Women who were moderately exposed to the famine had a 13% increased risk of breast cancer (HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.38; P(trend) = 0.016). The association between famine exposure and breast cancer risk was stronger for women who were exposed between the ages of 2 and 9 years (severely exposed versus unexposed: HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 0.92 to 4.41) than for women who were exposed at older ages.	The risk of breast cancer was increased in women who were severely exposed to a short but severe famine decades earlier. This result is compatible with data from the few animal studies investigating effects of short-term, transient caloric restriction.	2004
15019696	Bilateral multiple piloleiomyomas on the breast.	Piloleiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumors arising from the erector pilorum muscles in the skin. They vary in size and number, and are often spontaneously painful or sensitive to touch and cold. In this paper, we present two young female patients who have multiple breast piloleiomyoma and discuss the related findings.	2004
14768988	Management and follow-up of abnormal Papanicolaou tests.	Although less prevalent than breast cancer, cervical cancer has a lower 5-year survival rate. Cervical cancer is nearly always due to human papillomavirus (HPV). Increased screening and DNA typing for oncogenic HPV have begun to reduce the number of cases. Interpretation of Papanicolaou test results and disease management decisions require a comprehensive grasp of recent revisions in classification and management practice. This article reviews the recommendations of the multidisciplinary Bethesda 2001 Workshop and the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology. Practice changes include: new criteria for using liquid-based collection, a streamlined borderline category of atypical squamous cells (ASC), and a new category of ASC-cannot exclude high-grade lesion (ASC-H). Management includes colposcopy for all categories suspicious for epithelial abnormality and clearer guidelines for diagnostic colposcopy and endocervical sampling for glandular cell abnormalities (AGC, AGC-favor neoplasia). Adolescents and postmenopausal women have some variations from the recommended protocol. Reflex HPV DNA typing reflects the advances in research regarding risks for progression to cervical cancer. Treatment options include surgical removal of the lesions via laser, cryosurgery, loop excision, or cold-knife conization. Medical options include local treatments of cervical condyloma with tricloroacetic acid or 5-fluorouracil. Visible and sometimes functional cervical changes may result. Clinicians now have clearer guidelines with which to manage abnormal Papanicolaou test results, using the latest technology and research. Discussing abnormal results with patients requires great sensitivity.	2004
14760066	Neurophysiological study of peripheral neuropathy after high-dose Paclitaxel: lack of neuroprotective effect of amifostine.	To determine if there is a beneficial effect of amifostine in preventing or reducing the neuropathy induced by high-dose paclitaxel.	Breast cancer patients receiving high-dose infusional paclitaxel (725 mg/m(2)/24 h) in combination with doxorubicin (165 mg/m(2)/96 h) and cyclophosphamide (100 mg/kg/2 h; ACT) were studied on two autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant protocols, one with and one without amifostine (740 mg/m(2) administered over 10 min before and 12 h after initiation of the paclitaxel infusion). Patients were evaluated before ACT and 20-40 days later with neurological examination, a composite peripheral neuropathy score, peroneal and sural nerve conduction studies, and quantitative sensory testing.	There was no significant difference in paclitaxel maximum concentration, systemic clearance, or area under the curve determinations. Narcotic requirement as well as recovery of hematopoietic counts were also similar in subjects with or without amifostine. After ACT was administered, there was a decrease in peroneal nerve compound muscle action potential amplitude and sural nerve sensory action potential amplitude, as well as an increase in vibratory and cold detection thresholds. Clinical composite peripheral neuropathy scores were similar despite amifostine treatment; and logarithm to the base 2 ratios post/pre ACT showed no significant effect of amifostine on peroneal nerve compound muscle action potential, sural nerve sensory action potential, vibratory detection thresholds, or cold detection thresholds. All subjects had acroparesthesias and lost their ankle deep-tendon reflexes after administration of ACT.	Single high-dose paclitaxel produces predictable clinical and neurophysiological changes so that patients receiving high-dose therapy are ideal subjects to test the effectiveness of neuroprotective agents. Amifostine was ineffective in preventing or reducing the neurotoxicity of high-dose paclitaxel.	2004
14690155	Stage and survival in breast cancer patients in screened and non-screened Danish and Swedish populations.	Comparisons between the Danish and Swedish Cancer Registry revealed a 9% difference in 5-year survival for breast cancer patients diagnosed between 1983 and 1989. The purpose of this study was to determine whether previous differences in survival and stage still exist or whether the Danish figures approach those of the Swedish registry. Complete population-based cohorts of patients with breast cancer in the years 1996-1997 from well-defined areas in Denmark and Sweden were compared. The study regions were a Danish (Funen) and a Swedish (Malmö) county with mammography screening and two Danish counties without screening. No difference in extent of disease or survival was observed between screening areas regardless of country. However, there were significant differences in stage distribution and survival between screening populations and Danish non-screening populations, to the benefit of populations provided with a screening programme. Five-year survival was 5-6%, higher in screening populations than in Danish non-screening counties. Corresponding disease-specific survival enhanced the difference. In a multivariate analysis increasing age, tumour size and stage decreased survival. Adjusting for these factors eliminated differences in survival according to country/county. Survival difference could be attributed to early diagnosis and favourable stage in populations offered mammography screening and was not related to nation. Denmark may, through early detection, approach the beneficial stage distribution and survival observed in Sweden.	2003
14647296	Programmed cell death: Superman meets Dr Death.	This year's Cold Spring Harbor meeting on programmed cell death (September 17-21, 2003), organised by Craig Thompson and Junying Yuan, was proof that the 'golden age' of research in this field is far from over. There was a flurry of fascinating insights into the regulation of diverse apoptotic pathways and unexpected non-apoptotic roles for some of the key apoptotic regulators and effectors. In addition to their role in cell death, components of the apoptotic molecular machinery are now known to also function in a variety of essential cellular processes, such as regulating glucose homeostasis, lipid metabolism, cell proliferation and differentiation.	2003
14580851	Sequelae of cryotherapy in breast tissue.	Cryotherapy is a novel treatment for benign and malignant breast lesions that is under evaluation. We assessed the acute and subacute outcomes of breast cryotherapy in normal goat teats using physical, microscopic, and imaging modalities. Eight goats were subjected to two freeze-thaw cycles of breast tissue producing a 2cm iceball and sacrificed either 2 or 7 weeks later. Acute skin changes were minimal unless obvious tissue injury occurred during cryotherapy; however, depigmentation developed over several weeks in dark-skinned goats despite the presence of melanocytes. By histology, breast epithelial elements could not be identified at cryotherapy sites. There was no cystic degeneration, which is common at surgical excision sites. Neither calcifications nor prominent scarring could be attributed to cryotherapy on imaging studies after 2 or 7 weeks. When compared to standard breast surgery, the sequelae of cryotherapy using histologic, radiographic, and sonographic criteria were decreased. Our study suggests that cryotherapy, with technical modifications, is feasible within breast tissue and warrants further study.	2003
14580848	A microscale model for prediction of breast cancer cell damage during cryosurgery.	The morphology of cancerous breast tissue is characterized by tightly packed groups of small malignant cells, as found in most duct cell carcinoma. This special structure affects the osmotic responses of the cells to freezing and hence their probability of damage from cellular dehydration or intracellular ice formation. A mathematical model has been developed to study the microscale damage to these breast cancer cells during cryosurgery by accounting for their special structure. The model is based on a spherical unit comprised of an extracellular region that surrounds several layers of cancer cells, as experimentally observed of breast duct cell carcinoma by other researchers. Temperature transients in the breast cancer undergoing cryosurgery are calculated numerically using the Pennes equation. When subjected to various thermal histories, both cellular dehydration and intracellular ice formation in the unit structure are examined by considering the cell-to-cell contact and water transport at the microscale level. It is found that the cells in the inner layers hardly dehydrated while those in the outermost layer do greatly. The results help interpret the previously observed experimental phenomena that breast cancer tissues exhibit intracellular ice formation even at a slow cooling rate of -3 degrees C/min. In the attempt to better define an optimal procedure for breast cancer cryosurgery, various freezing protocols are simulated. The constant heat flux protocol induces greater cellular dehydration and higher intracellular ice formation probability simultaneously compared to the other protocols studied.	2003

12975311	Representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis: a high-resolution method to detect genome copy number variation.	We have developed a methodology we call ROMA (representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis), for the detection of the genomic aberrations in cancer and normal humans. By arraying oligonucleotide probes designed from the human genome sequence, and hybridizing with "representations" from cancer and normal cells, we detect regions of the genome with altered "copy number." We achieve an average resolution of 30 kb throughout the genome, and resolutions as high as a probe every 15 kb are practical. We illustrate the characteristics of probes on the array and accuracy of measurements obtained using ROMA. Using this methodology, we identify variation between cancer and normal genomes, as well as between normal human genomes. In cancer genomes, we readily detect amplifications and large and small homozygous and hemizygous deletions. Between normal human genomes, we frequently detect large (100 kb to 1 Mb) deletions or duplications. Many of these changes encompass known genes. ROMA will assist in the discovery of genes and markers important in cancer, and the discovery of loci that may be important in inherited predispositions to disease.	2003
12926103	Early phase II study of the new aromatase inhibitor YM511 in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer. Difficulty in clinical dose recommendation based on preclinical and phase I findings.	A phase II study of a non-steroidal selective aromatase inhibitor, YM511, 4-[N-bromobenzyl]-N-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)amino) benzonitrile, was conducted to evaluate the anti-tumor response, dose-dependence of response rate and tolerability in postmenopausal patients with advanced breast cancer.	Patients were randomly allocated to a dose of 0.3, 1, 3, 10 or 30 mg after stratification according to PS, previous therapy and ER, and were administered the drug orally once a day.	Of 98 eligible patients, 6 achieved complete response (CR) and 14 partial response (PR), resulting in an objective response rate of 20.4%. In addition, 13 patients achieved NC lasting more than 24 weeks (L-NC), resulting in an overall success rate of 33.7%. However, no clear dose-dependence of response rate was observed. Significant reduction of serum estradiol level was observed at all doses. Median time to progression of disease was 61-233 days. Toxicity was mild or moderate in severity. Fifty-five adverse events were reported in 38 patients, the most common being gastrointestinal disorders such as nausea, vomiting and anorexia (18 events) and constitutional symptoms such as asthenia, hot flushes and common cold syndrome (14 events). The frequency of drug-related adverse events was not dose-related. Abnormalities in hematological laboratory values and blood biochemistry, which were probably drug-related, were less than 5% in frequency except for cholesterol level, and were light or moderate in severity.	YM511 appeared to be effective and safe in postmenopausal patients with breast cancer. Dose-dependent increase in response rate was not clearly observed at doses from 0.3 mg/day to 30 mg/day. The recommended dose of YM511 for further studies is 0.3 mg or less than 0.3 mg.
12888375	Time trends and regional differences in registration, stage distribution, surgical management and survival of breast cancer in Denmark.	The aim of this study was to analyse time trends, stage at diagnosis, survival and registration of population-based cohorts of breast cancer patients in selected Danish counties (in total 2504) in 1986 and 1996-1997. In 1986, no differences in the extent of disease were observed between the counties. Patients from one county (Funen) had centralised surgery, significantly more lymph nodes removed and a better survival in the multivariate analysis. In 1996-1997, mammographical screening had been implemented in Funen, leading to a significantly better stage distribution, whereas stage remained unchanged in the other counties. In Funen, survival was significantly better than in the other counties in univariate, but not in multivariate analysis. Survival increased significantly with time only in Funen. Inclusion in clinical trials increased over time and the coverage of the database in the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG) was high. However, patients not notified in DBCG had, beside older age, also worse stage of disease distribution and less extensive surgery. A difference in survival was observed between the counties. In 1986, this may be explained by a centralised surgical system in one county, whereas in 1996-1997 improvements could be due to an early diagnosis and other as yet unknown factors. The DBCG database cannot be considered as representative of the Danish population of breast cancer patients.	2003
12883701	Factors that influence the incidence of microscopic carcinoma in frozen and preserved specimens from patients with breast carcinoma after breast-conserving surgery.	Because a positive margin is an important risk factor for decreased survival of patients with breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery (BCS), we examined the rate of positive surgical margins after BCS, determined from intraoperative frozen and preserved sections, and we assessed factors that influence the incidence of positive margins in surgical specimens. The cases of 172 patients who underwent BCS between June 1989 and March 2001 were studied. The pathologic features and positive margins were evaluated by microscopic examination of frozen and preserved sections. The grade of each positive margin was arbitrarily classified into one of four groups: i) cancer involved; ii) closed margin (<2 mm); iii) partially closed margin (>3 mm and <5 mm) and iv) free margin (>5 mm). Biomarkers were estimated by immunohistochemistry and DNA ploidy, and the relationship of clinical parameters was statistically analyzed using the chi(2) test. In 59 of 172 cases (34.3%), the surgical margin was positive: horizontal in 47 cases (27.3%) and vertical in 12 cases (6.9%). The free margin was significantly correlated with positive status of estrogen and progesterone receptors and middle age (35-50 years) in the patients, while clinicopathologic factors were not correlated with positive margins in surgical specimens. Although 17 cases of cancer were found in 9 frozen specimens and 8 preserved sections, the mammographic findings showed spiculated masses in 7 of the 9 frozen specimens (77.7%) and 4 of the 8 preserved sections (50%), and microcalcification in 2 frozen specimens (22.2%) and 4 preserved sections (50%). The overexpression (2+ or 3+) of the HER-2 protein was found in 8 of the 9 frozen specimens (87.5%) and in 7 of the 8 preserved sections (88.8%). In the 11 cases with spiculated masses, extensive intraductal components (EICs) of various grades were found; the presence of EICs in a spiculated lesion was observed in 5 of the 7 frozen specimens and in all 4 of the preserved sections. The local extension of breast carcinoma cells in BCS is associated in part with the findings of spiculation and microcalcification, which are associated with EICs. The overexpression of HER-2 protein appears to play a role in EICs in positive margins, and needs to be considered for avoiding positive margins in BCS on patients with breast carcinoma.

12794115	Transfection of dendritic cells with RNA induces CD4- and CD8-mediated T cell immunity against breast carcinomas and reveals the immunodominance of presented T cell epitopes.	Transfection of dendritic cells (DC) with tumor-derived RNA has recently been shown to elicit tumor-specific CTL capable of recognizing and lysing a variety of tumor cells. In our study we analyzed the induction of HLA class I- and II-restricted T cell responses against MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Using this approach we were able to elicit CD4- and CD8-mediated antitumor responses. The CTL specifically lysed MCF-7 cells and DC electroporated with MCF-7 RNA, but spared control cell lines. The specificity of the cytotoxic activity was confirmed in cold target inhibition assays and using mAbs blocking HLA class I molecules. Interestingly, these polyclonal cytotoxic T cells recognized selectively two epitopes derived from the MUC1 and Her-2/neu tumor Ags. The induced Th cells were found to be entirely HLA class II restricted and showed a significant cross-reactivity to a renal cell carcinoma cell line, similar to the results obtained with cytotoxic T cells.	2003
12768403	Scalp hypothermia to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia is effective and safe: a pilot study of a new digitized scalp-cooling system used in 74 patients.	The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy and safety of a new digitized, controlled, scalp-cooling system to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia.	Seventy-four female cancer patients who received 13 varying chemotherapy regimens were included in a nonrandomized pilot study. The Digni 2-3 with Dignicap system consists of a refrigerator unit and a control unit integrated into a mobile cabinet and connected to a tight-fitting cooling cap. This system maintains a constant scalp temperature of +5 degrees C for many hours. In this study, 60 patients were treated for ovarian cancer with either taxane or epirubicin combination chemotherapy. Eight patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, three with breast cancer, two with endometrial cancer, and one with sarcoma were also included. Photo documentation and patient assessment of hair loss and discomfort were performed.	In anthracycline-treated patients, total prevention of hair loss was observed, whereas hair loss in paclitaxel/docetaxel-treated patients was minimal to none. The combination of anthracycline and taxane resulted in more hair loss, but only three of six patients used a wig. Scalp cooling was generally very well tolerated; only two of 74 patients discontinued use of the cold cap due to discomfort. No scalp metastases occurred over a median follow-up period of 15 months.	The digitized, controlled, scalp-cooling system represents an effective and safe device that should be clinically evaluated in a randomized trial and in studies using other chemotherapy regimens to determine optimal temperatures and durations of cooling for maximal efficacy.	2003

12756252	Characterization of the metastasis-associated protein, S100A4. Roles of calcium binding and dimerization in cellular localization and interaction with myosin.	Elevated S100A4 protein expression is associated with metastatic tumor progression and appears to be a strong molecular marker for clinical prognosis. S100A4 is a calcium-binding protein that is known to form homodimers and interacts with several proteins in a calcium-dependent manner. Here we show that S100A4 localizes to lamellipodia structures in a migrating breast cancer-derived cell line and colocalizes with a known S100A4-interacting protein, myosin heavy chain IIA, at the leading edge. We demonstrate that S100A4 mutants that are defective in either their ability to dimerize or in calcium binding are unable to interact with myosin heavy chain IIA. An S100A4 mutant that is deficient for calcium binding retains the ability to form homodimers, suggesting that S100A4 can exist as calcium-free or calcium-bound dimers in vivo. However, a calcium-bound S100A4 monomer only interacts with another calcium-bound monomer and not with an S100A4 mutant that does not bind calcium. Interestingly, despite the calcium dependence for interaction with known protein partners, calcium binding is not necessary for localization to lamellipodia. Both wild type and a mutant that is deficient for calcium binding colocalize with known markers of actively forming leading edges of lamellipodia, Arp3 and neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. These data suggest that S100A4 localizes to the leading edge in a calcium-independent manner, and identification of the proteins that are involved in localizing S100A4 to the lamellipodial structures may provide novel insight into the mechanism by which S100A4 regulates metastasis.	2003
12695516	YB-1 as a cell cycle-regulated transcription factor facilitating cyclin A and cyclin B1 gene expression.	Expression of the Y-box protein YB-1 is increased in proliferating normal and cancer cells, but its role in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression is unclear. We have identified a cell cycle-dependent relocalization of YB-1 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus at the G1/S phase transition and demonstrate that both the charged zipper and the cold shock domain are involved in regulating this process. Using cell lines that constitutively overexpress YB-1, we show that nuclear accumulation of YB-1 is associated with increased cyclin A and cyclin B1 mRNA and protein expression. We provide evidence that deregulated YB-1 expression is linked to adhesion-independent cell proliferation through the induction of cyclin A. Thus, we have identified YB-1 as a cell cycle stage-specific transcription factor important for cell proliferation.	2003
12673507	[Frozen section telepathology in the clinical routine of a breast cancer center].	For an intraoperative frozen section service, the period from surgeon's sample excision to the time of transmitting the diagnosis by the pathologist, should not last longer than 20 min. In a period of 16 months we performed 389 frozen sections by telepathology (298 patients) in our breast cancer center, using the Leica telepathology system (TPS 1.5). In 173 out of the 389 sections, an invasive carcinoma was diagnosed (312 frozen sections with the aim to verify malignancy and 77 to verify a tumor-free retroareolar resection margin). The overall error rate amounted to 7 out of 389 sections (about 2%; false-negative in 5 cases, false-positive in 2 cases) and is equivalent to the error rate without telepathology. The mean time for diagnosis per case was 15 min. For the future, it is desirable that hospitals without their own pathologists also perform frozen sections within an adequate time by using telepathology systems.	2003
12658474	[Atypical Leriche syndrome].	A 73-year old woman presented with mild paraparesis and hypesthesia of the legs. Furthermore, she complained dizziness, fainting and dyspnea. There was a history of peripheral artery disease, diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension and chronic atrial fibrillation. Five years ago she had breast cancer with removal of the left mamma and additional radiation therapy. Cardiac catheterization at that time demonstrated no significant coronary stenoses. A contrast-enhanced CT-scan excluded lumbal spinal metastases. Instead, a subtotal occlusion of the abdominal aorta was noticed, but was initially interpreted as a chronic thrombosis because there were no typical symptoms and only moderate pain. About 24 hours later the patient developed an acute ischemic syndrome of the legs with progressive paraparesis, cold and pale legs in combination with acidosis and hyperventilation. Color-coded duplex ultrasound showed only a small turbulent flow in the ilial arteries, highly suspicious of a complete occlusion of the distal aorta. Angiography revealed an acute total occlusion of the infrarenal aorta without collaterals. During surgical intervention, complete obstruction of the abdominal aorta above the bifurcation was confirmed. Subsequent embolectomy was performed and an embolus consisting of several layers of different age was extracted. After successful surgical intervention with subsequent clinical improvement, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated a few day later. She died on day 9 after surgery from a complete ischemia of the small intestine and the colon ascendens.	2003
12630082	Effect of freezing on histologic grading of invasive ductal breast cancer.	To quantify the histologic changes caused by freezing during tissue processing and their influence on histologic malignancy grading as a prognostic factor in invasive ductal breast cancer.	We studied frozen and nonfrozen formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of 18 cases of invasive ductal breast cancer. Features associated with histologic malignancy grading of breast cancer--i.e., nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic index and tubular differentiation--were assessed by quantitative morphometric methods.	In our material, frozen samples consistently had a smaller mean nuclear profile area than nonfrozen samples (mean difference, 32%). Frozen nuclei were also clearly less symmetric and uniform in shape than non-frozen nuclei. Moreover, frozen samples had consistently higher mitotic indices than nonfrozen samples (mean difference, 66%, with the standardized mitotic index). Tubular differentiation, as expressed in fraction of fields with tubular differentiation, increased by 16% as a result of sample freezing.	According to our results of morphometric measurement in invasive ductal breast cancer, great caution should be exercised when prognostic conclusions are based on frozen tissue samples.	2003
12613336	[Thyroid metastasis from renal carcinoma. Clinical case].	Metastatic thyroid tumours are uncommon among reported clinical cases, but are more frequent in autopsy series. The most common sites of the primary tumours are the breast (21%), kidney (12%) and lung (11%) and in some cases are detected only at autopsy. The clinical presence of thyroid tumefaction, whether associated or not with compressive symptoms, in a patient with a history of surgical treatment for renal cell carcinoma should lead to the suspicion of a metastatic nodule. The most important diagnostic technique is cytological examination after fine needle aspiration biopsy, combined with immunohistochemical staining. Total thyroidectomy, whether associated or not with radiation therapy, is the procedure of choice in these cases, when possible, above all in the presence of regional symptoms. In spite of treatment, however, the prognosis of metastatic disease is very poor. Therapeutic measures allow a mean survival of 34 months in the various reported series. The authors report the case of a 66-year-old female patient who had undergone left-side nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma 7 years earlier. The woman presented an increased thyroid volume mainly on the right side, with signs of tracheal compression. Ultrasonography of the thyroid gland and fine needle aspiration cytology showed malignant features. Scintigraphy strongly suggested the presence of a cold nodule in the right lobe. Subsequently, total thyroidectomy was performed and the histological examination revealed that the nodule was composed of tumour cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and round nuclei; with the characteristics of the renal cell carcinoma resected 7 years previously. Since computed tomography revealed secondaries in the lungs, the patient is still being managed with chemotherapy, with arrest of the metastatic progression, and is in a fairly good clinical condition.
12610356	Rapid immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin in the intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes for metastatic breast carcinoma.	The sensitivity and specificity of detecting metastatic breast carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes using a rapid immunohistochemistry technique was determined and compared with methods currently used at the authors' institution. At the time of intraoperative consultation, after routine diagnostic touch preparations and frozen sections were prepared, 6-microm frozen sections of 72 sentinel lymph nodes from 32 patients with breast carcinoma were placed on plus slides, fixed in cold acetone for 2 or 3 minutes, and stored at -70 degrees C. These sections were immunostained with a prediluted broad-spectrum anticytokeratin monoclonal antibody coupled to an inert polymer with horseradish peroxidase (DAKO EPOS). Slides were ready for interpretation within 16 minutes and were scored as positive, negative, or equivocal for metastatic carcinoma. Results were compared with those of the intraoperative touch preparations and frozen sections and with paraffin-embedded, hematoxylin and eosin-stained, and AE1/AE3 immunostained permanent sections. Fourteen (19%) sentinel lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma in 13 patients. All methods tested were 100% specific. The rapid immunohistochemistry method was the least sensitive (57% sensitivity) of all methods used to detect metastasis. Routine diagnostic touch preparations, frozen sections, and permanent sections had sensitivities of 69%, 86%, and 100% respectively. In conclusion, this rapid immunohistochemistry method would not be helpful in intraoperative assessment of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients due to its low sensitivity.	2003
12584740	Treatment of colon and breast carcinoma cells with 5-fluorouracil enhances expression of carcinoembryonic antigen and susceptibility to HLA-A(*)02.01 restricted, CEA-peptide-specific cytotoxic T cells in vitro.	Cancer vaccines directed against tumor associate antigen (TAA) have produced encouraging results in preclinical models but not in cancer patients. A major limitation of this strategy is the relative degree of tolerance to these antigens and the low and heterogeneous tumor cell expression of TAA and major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Previous studies have shown that 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) can upregulate the expression of membrane-associated carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), and MHC molecules in colon and breast carcinoma cell lines. We have investigated whether this drug can also enhance their sensitivity to the lytic effects of CEA-peptide specific Cytotoxic T cell lymphocytes (CTL). The CEA peptide-specific CTLs generated in our laboratory from normal HLA-A(*)02.01(+) donor PBMCs, were able to kill HLA-A(*)02.01(+)/CEA(+) breast (MCF-7-T103) and colon (HLA-A(*)02.01 gene-transfected HT-29 and C22.20) carcinoma cells in HLA-A(*)02.01 restricted manner. The treatment of target cells with 5-FU, enhanced their CEA expression and susceptibility to CTL-mediated lysis. Cold competition assays confirmed these results, thus supporting the hypothesis that immune target cell lysis and 5-FU mediated enhancement were dependent on CEA peptide presentation by cancer cells. 5-FU treatment of functionally "mature" CTL after in vitro expansion, did not reduce their cytolytic activity against MT-2 target cells but, when the anti-metabolite was added during the immune-sensitization phase, CTL generation was significantly inhibited. These results provide a rationale for investigating a possible new role of 5-FU as an immuno targeting amplifier agent in breast and colorectal cancer patients immunized with CEA-directed cancer vaccines.	2003
12506484	[A case of recurrent breast cancer with carcinomatous pleurisy successfully treated with combined chemoendocrine-therapy of CTF (CPA, THP and 5-FU) and anastrozole following instillation therapy 12 years after radical mastectomy].	A 52-year-old female underwent radical mastectomy at the age of 41 for left breast cancer (n0, positive for ER). After a few years of adjuvant TAM therapy, follow-up was stopped at the age of 50 with no recurrence. She had suffered from symptoms of cold since January 2001 and came to our hospital complaining dyspnea on February 11. CXP showed pleural effusion of the entire thoracic cavity and she was admitted to the hospital immediately. Pleural exudate cytodiagnosis showed carcinomatous pleurisy; however, dyspnea and thoracic effusion were improved by continuous thoracic drainage and instillation therapy. Various examinations demonstrated that the carcinomatous pleurisy was due to recurrent breast cancer. They also showed local recurrence, left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis and multiple bone metastasis. Thus, combined chemoendocrine-therapy of CTF (CPA, THP and 5-FU) and anastrozole was administered. After 6 cycles of CTF, the carcinomatous pleurisy, local recurrence and left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis were diagnosed as CR by CXP, chest CT and US and multiple bone metastasis were diagnosed as PR by bone scintigram. The patient continues to be treated on an outpatient basis with no recurrence about one year after the beginning of the treatment (6 months after CTF 6 cycles) and she is taking anastrozole continuously.	2002
12496045	Insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-binding proteins, and breast cancer.	Epidemiological evidence supports a role for the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) in the induction and progression of various cancers. Estrogen, which plays a role in the etiology of breast cancer, both regulates and is influenced by the IGF family. Risk of breast cancer associated with serum levels of IGF-I and/or IGFBPs may therefore depend upon menopausal status. A nested, case-control study was conducted on 66 women who were premenopausal and 60 who were postmenopausal at the time of diagnosis of primary breast cancer; they were selected from a cohort of 95,000 women who underwent multiphasic health check-ups > 30 years ago when enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program. For each case, one control who matched by age, date of examination, and length of follow-up was chosen. Concentrations of IGF-I, insulin, glucose, and IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 in serum drawn at least 2 years before diagnosis (mean times of 10.5 and 15.8 years for pre- and postmenopausal cases, respectively) were compared using conditional logistic regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Serum IGF-I, adjusted for insulin, glucose, and body mass index, was weakly associated with breast cancer risk across quartiles for premenopausal women only (P for trend = 0.05). Serum IGFBP-3 was higher in premenopausal cases versus controls (P = 0.04) and showed a positive trend in risk for increasing quartiles (P for trend = 0.033). After adjusting for insulin, glucose, body mass index, and IGF-I, premenopausal women in the highest quartile of IGFBP-3 had an elevated risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 5.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-24.7]. Conversely, IGFBP-3 was lower in postmenopausal cases versus controls (P = 0.04) but showed no significant trend in risk. Postmenopausal women with glucose levels in the diabetic range were at increased risk for developing breast cancer (OR = 2.06, 95% CI = 0.87-4.91), whereas those in the highest quartile of IGFBP-2 had a substantial reduction (71%) in risk relative to those in the lowest quartile (OR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.09-0.92). Serum IGFBP-1 was not associated with breast cancer risk in either pre- or postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women, elevated serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 are associated with increased breast cancer risk, whereas elevated serum IGFBP-2 is inversely associated with risk of postmenopausal breast cancer.	2002
12429628	Toxicity, immunogenicity, and induction of E75-specific tumor-lytic CTLs by HER-2 peptide E75 (369-377) combined with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor in HLA-A2+ patients with metastatic breast and ovarian cancer.	To determine the toxicity and immunogenicity of the HER-2/neu, HLA-A2-restricted peptide E75 in patients with metastatic breast and ovarian cancer, 14 patients were vaccinated with escalating amounts of E75 (100, 500, and 1000 microg) mixed with 250 microg granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor as adjuvant. Each vaccine dose was administered in a total volume of 1.5 ml divided into four intradermal injections and administered weekly for 4 weeks, followed by monthly boosts for a total of 10 injections. Vaccinations were well tolerated without significant toxicity. Blood was drawn before, at 8 weeks, and up to 13-16 months after vaccination for measurement of cellular immunity. Seven of 8 patients tested had significant delayed type hypersensitivity to E75 defined as >5 mm induration. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 5 of 9 patients tested proliferated to E75 with a stimulation index of > or = 2.0. Of 8 vaccinated patients tested for induction of a CTL response, 4 responded to stimulation by autologous dendritic cells plus cytokines by eliciting E75-specific lytic activity consistent with the presence of activated/memory cells, 2 others after in vitro stimulation with E75 + interleukin-12 +/- anti-CD152(33KD), whereas 2 others did not respond. Four patients with E75-specific CTLs present specifically recognized E75 on indicator tumors as demonstrated by cold-target inhibition of tumor lysis. These 4 patients showed E75-specific IFN-gamma production. peripheral blood mononuclear cell from 3 of these patients proliferated to E75, but stimulation indices were higher in the prevaccine samples. All 4 of the patients showed DTH responses to E75. These results demonstrate that vaccination with E75+ granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor can induce both peptide-specific IFN-gamma and epitope specific CTLs, which lyse HER-2/neu+ tumors in stage IV patients.	2002
12370419	DBC2, a candidate for a tumor suppressor gene involved in breast cancer.	A previously uncharacterized gene, DBC2 (deleted in breast cancer), was cloned from a homozygously deleted region at human chromosome 8p21. DBC2 contains a highly conserved RAS domain and two putative protein interacting domains. Our analyses indicate that DBC2 is the best candidate tumor suppressor gene from this region. It lies within the epicenter of the deletions and is homozygously deleted in 3.5% (7/200) of breast tumors. Mutation analysis of DBC2 led to discovery of two instances of somatic missense mutations in breast tumor specimens, whereas no missense mutations were found in other candidates from the region. Unlike other genes in the region, expression of DBC2 is often extinguished in breast cancer cells or tissues. Moreover, our functional analysis revealed that DBC2 expression in breast cancer cells lacking DBC2 transcripts causes growth inhibition. By contrast, expression of a somatic mutant discovered in a breast cancer specimen does not suppress the growth of breast cancer cells.	2002
12206513	Prognostic value of thermographical findings in patients with primary breast cancer.	Thermography is a technique to measure the body surface temperature and is used in medical applications. We evaluated its prognostic value in 340 female patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer without distant metastases. The difference of mean temperatures of the tumor area and corresponding area of the contralateral breast was defined as AT. The patients with hot tumors (delta T > or = 0.9 degrees C) had significantly worse disease free and specific survival than those with cold tumors (delta T < 0.9 degrees C) (p = 0.0003 and p < 0.0001, respectively). AT was significantly correlated with tumor size, histological nodal status and nuclear grade, positively. But AT did not have any relation with estrogen receptor status. Multivariate analyses including those conventional prognostic factors showed that AT was a marginally significant prognostic factor for disease-free survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.62; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.99-2.66, p = 0.0557) and an independent significant prognostic one for disease specific survival (HR = 1.95; 95% CI = 1.09-3.49, p = 0.0251). However, AT did not have prognostic impact on the node negative patients. AT might be a useful prognostic factor in node positive breast cancer, especially in patients who plan to be treated with preoperative systemic therapy.	2002
12206847	The cryobiology of cryosurgical injury.	Cryosurgery, or tissue destruction by controlled freezing, has been investigated as a possible alternative to surgical intervention in the treatment of many diseases. This technique, which is under the larger category of thermal therapy, has its origins in the 1800s when advanced carcinomas of the breast and uterine cervix were treated with iced saline solutions. Since those early times, this technique has been used routinely to treat malignancies on the surface of the body (ie, dermatologic tumors) and has gained some acceptance as a clinical tool for the management of internal malignancies, including carcinoma of the prostate and kidney. The main advantages of the technique are the potential for less invasiveness and lower morbidity compared with surgical excision. The study of the destructive process of freezing is the focus of this article and is divided into 2 main areas: (1) understanding the mechanism by which freezing destroys tissue, and (2) understanding the thermal history that causes tissue destruction. The term "thermal history," as used in this article, will mean the time-temperature history experienced by the tissue during a thermal insult.	2002

12168854	Selective inhibition of tumoral cells growth by low power millimeter waves.	The effects of low power millimetric wave (MMW) radiation on the growth of tumor and healthy cells were studied. A wide-band frequency range between 53.57-78.33 GHz with a radiation density power of 27 x 10(-17) watt/Hz were used. The radiating energy was low enough not to increase the temperature of the cellular samples (cold irradiation). One hour of radiation treatment given every other day to three tumoral human stable cell lines, produced a noticeable inhibition of the cellular growth. The analogous treatment given to two healthy cell lines gave a weak growth stimulation. A scanning electron microscopy study of MCF-7-and K562-irradiated cells revealed that MMW irradiation induced profound morphological changes of the membrane. Finally, we also provided a mechanistic indication, based on millimeter wave spectroscopy of the cells: water is the primary absorber of these electromagnetic waves. Our work provides interesting evidence that wide band low power MMW irradiation, in the appropriate frequency range, could be used in the future as a cold means to cause selective inhibition of tumor cell growth.

12080536	The oncology nurse's role in educating patients on endocrine therapy for metastatic breast cancer--focus on fulvestrant.	Fulvestrant, an estrogen receptor downregulator, is an effective and a safe endocrine option for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who progress or develop recurrent disease on prior endocrine therapy. The recommended dose is 250 mg given as a single 5-mL or 2 concurrent 2.5-mL monthly intramuscular injections. Common adverse events associated with fulvestrant are hot flashes, nausea, and mild injection site reactions. Applying warm or cold compresses to the injection site can minimize injection site reactions. In randomized double-blind clinical trials, the frequency of injection site reactions for fulvestrant are no different from the comparator (anastrozole) arm. Overall, fulvestrant has a safety profile similar to aromatase inhibitors. Advantages of this agent are its effectiveness in tamoxifen-resistant tumors and the lack of agonistic property, creating a favorable side-effect profile. One limitation is that there is no evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of fulvestrant in premenopausal women. Among endocrine therapies used to treat breast cancer, fulvestrant is unique not only in its mechanism of action but also in its mode of administration. With oral therapies, the patient fills the prescription in a pharmacy and takes the medication home. In contrast, with monthly fulvestrant intramuscular injection, the patient will have increased contact with the nurse. The increased interaction between the patient and the nurse will affect the role of nurses providing patient education and monitoring.	2002
12040007	Functional microarray analysis of mammary organogenesis reveals a developmental role in adaptive thermogenesis.	The use of DNA microarrays to study vertebrate organogenesis presents unique analytical challenges compared with expression profiling of homogeneous cell populations. We have used a general approach that permits the automated, unbiased identification of biologically relevant patterns of gene expression to study murine mammary gland development. Our studies confirm the utility of this approach by demonstrating the ready identification of cellular processes and pathways of known functional importance in mammary development. Additionally, this approach permitted the identification of genetic pathways with unpredicted patterns of developmental regulation, including those involved in angiogenesis, extracellular matrix synthesis, and the beta-oxidation of fatty acids. Surprisingly, our findings demonstrate that the coordinate regulation of genes involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids reflects the presence of an abundant, yet previously unrecognized stromal compartment within the mammary gland that is composed of brown adipose tissue. Our data demonstrate that the amount of brown adipose tissue present in the mammary gland is developmentally regulated; that PPARalpha, Ucp1, and genes involved in fatty acid oxidation are spatially and temporally coregulated during development; that the mammary gland plays a functional role in adaptive thermogenesis; and that the transcriptional control of this adaptive response to cold is itself developmentally regulated.	2002
12009951	A 99mTc(I)-postlabeled high affinity bombesin analogue as a potential tumor imaging agent.	The overexpression of neuropeptide receptors observed in many cancers provides an attractive target for tumor imaging and therapy. Bombesin is a peptide exhibiting a high affinity for the gastrin releasing peptide (GRP) receptor, which is overexpressed by a variety of tumors such as breast or prostate cancer. In the present study, we have evaluated if the bombesin analogue [N(alpha)-histidinyl acetate]bombesin(7-14), radiolabeled with the novel [99mTc(OH(2))(3)(CO)(3)]+, has the potential to be used as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical. Receptor saturation studies, carried out on the GRP receptor-expressing PC-3 human prostate cancer cell line, revealed for [99mTc(CO)(3)-N(alpha)-histidinyl acetate]bombesin(7-14) K(d) values in the subnanomolar range. Competitive binding assays, using the cold rhenium(I)-labeled analogue as a surrogate for the 99mTc-conjugate, also showed high affinity binding. Incubation of the radioconjugate with PC-3 cells resulted in a rapid temperature- and time-dependent specific internalization. At 37 degrees C more than 70% was internalized within the first 15 min and remained constant up to 2 h. Despite the weak proteolytic stability of [99mTc(CO)(3)-N(alpha)-histidinyl acetate]bombesin(7-14) in vitro, biodistribution studies, performed in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice, showed low uptake in the tumor (0.89 +/- 0.27% ID/g 30 min pi) but high uptake into the pancreas (7.11 +/- 3.93% ID/g 30 min pi), a GRP receptor-positive organ. Blockade experiment (coinjection of 300 microg bombesin/mouse with the radioligand) showed specificity of the uptake. Despite the low tumor uptake, tumor-to-blood ratios of 2.0 and 2.7 and tumor-to-muscle ratios of 8.9 and 8.0 were obtained at 30 min and 1.5 h postinjection, respectively. The promising results merit the future in vivo investigation of 99mTc/188Re-tricarbonyl-labeled bombesin analogues.
12006532	Development and validation of a method for using breast core needle biopsies for gene expression microarray analyses.	Gene expression microarray technologies have the potential to define molecular profiles that may identify specific phenotypes(diagnosis), establish a patient's expected clinical outcome (prognosis), and indicate the likelihood of a beneficial effect of a specific therapy (prediction). We wished to develop optimal tissue acquisition, processing, and analysis procedures for exploring the gene expression profiles of breast core needle biopsies representing cancer and noncancer tissues.	Human breast cancer xenografts were used to evaluate several processing methods for prospectively collecting adequate amounts of high-quality RNA for gene expression microarray studies. Samples were assessed for the preservation of tissue architecture and the quality and quantity of RNA recovered. An optimized protocol was applied to a small study of core needle breast biopsies from patients, in which we compared the molecular profiles from cancer with those from noncancer biopsies. Gene expression data were obtained using Research Genetics, Inc. Named Genes cDNA microarrays. Data were visualized using simple hierarchical clustering and a novel principal component analysis-based multidimensional scaling. Data dimensionality was reduced by simple statistical approaches. Predictive neural networks were built using a multilayer perceptron and evaluated in an independent data set from snap-frozen mastectomy specimens.	Processing tissue through RNALater preserves tissue architecture when biopsies are washed for 5 min on ice with ice-cold PBS before histopathological analysis. Cell margins are clear, tissue folding and fragmentation are not observed, and integrity of the cores is maintained, allowing optimal pathological interpretation and preservation of important diagnostic information. Adequate concentrations of high-quality RNA are recovered; 51 of 55 biopsies produced a median of 1.34 microg of total RNA (range, 100 ng to 12.60 microg). Snap-freezing or the use of RNALater does not affect RNA recovery or the molecular profiles obtained from biopsies. The neural network predictors accurately discriminate between predominantly cancer and noncancer breast biopsies.	The approaches generated in these studies provide a simple, safe, and effective method for prospectively acquiring and processing breast core needle biopsies for gene expression studies. Gene expression data from these studies can be used to build accurate predictive models that separate different molecular profiles. The data establish the use and effectiveness of these approaches for future prospective studies.	2002
12002340	Chemopreventive and adjuvant therapeutic potential of pomegranate (Punica granatum) for human breast cancer.	Fresh organically grown pomegranates (Punica granatum L.) of the Wonderful cultivar were processed into three components: fermented juice, aqueous pericarp extract and cold-pressed or supercritical CO2-extracted seed oil. Exposure to additional solvents yielded polyphenol-rich fractions ('polyphenols') from each of the three components. Their actions, and of the crude whole oil and crude fermented and unfermented juice concentrate, were assessed in vitro for possible chemopreventive or adjuvant therapeutic potential in human breast cancer. The ability to effect a blockade of endogenous active estrogen biosynthesis was shown by polyphenols from fermented juice, pericarp, and oil, which inhibited aromatase activity by 60-80%. Fermented juice and pericarp polyphenols, and whole seed oil, inhibited 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Type 1 from 34 to 79%, at concentrations ranging from 100 to 1,000 microg/ml according to seed oil >> fermented juice polyphenols > pericarp polyphenols. In a yeast estrogen screen (YES) lyophilized fresh pomegranate juice effected a 55% inhibition of the estrogenic activity of 17-beta-estradiol; whereas the lyophilized juice by itself displayed only minimal estrogenic action. Inhibition of cell lines by fermented juice and pericarp polyphenols was according to estrogen-dependent (MCF-7) >> estrogen-independent (MB-MDA-231) > normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). In both MCF-7 and MB-MDA-231 cells, fermented pomegranate juice polyphenols consistently showed about twice the anti-proliferative effect as fresh pomegranate juice polyphenols. Pomegranate seed oil effected 90% inhibition of proliferation of MCF-7 at 100 microg/ml medium, 75% inhibition of invasion of MCF-7 across a Matrigel membrane at 10 microg/ml, and 54% apoptosis in MDA-MB-435 estrogen receptor negative metastatic human breast cancer cells at 50 microg/ml. In a murine mammary gland organ culture, fermented juice polyphenols effected 47% inhibition of cancerous lesion formation induced by the carcinogen 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). The findings suggest that clinical trials to further assess chemopreventive and adjuvant therapeutic applications of pomegranate in human breast cancer may be warranted.	2002
11977539	[CGS 20267 (Letrozole), a new aromatase inhibitor: early phase II study for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer].	A multicenter, open labeled, randomized early Phase II study for CGS 20267 was conducted at the doses 0.5 mg once daily and 1.0 mg once daily in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to the doses of either 0.5 mg once daily (n = 33) or 1.0 mg once daily (n = 31). Thirty-one patients were eligible for 0.5 mg group, and 29 for 1.0 mg group. A total of 57 patients (30 in the 0.5 mg group and 27 in the 1.0 mg group) were eligible for the evaluation of efficacy. There were 3 CR, 5 PR, 5 stable disease (SD: NC lasting over 24 weeks), 7 NC and 10 PD in the 0.5 mg group. The objective response rate (ORR) was 26.7%. There were 4 CR, 7 PR, 8 SD, 3 NC and 5 PD in the 1.0 mg group. The ORR was 40.7%. A total of 57 patients (29 in the 0.5 mg group and 28 in the 1.0 mg group) were eligible for safety evaluation. Adverse clinical events related to CGS 20267 in the 0.5 mg group were headache, nausea, cold sweat, sleepiness and muscle ache in the lower extremities (2 patients, incidence rate 6.9%) whereas those in the 1.0 mg group were generalized itching and generalized hot feeling (2 patients, incidence rate 7.1%). All of the adverse events were grade 1 except the generalized itching which was grade 2. CGS 20267-related abnormalities in the laboratory tests for the 0.5 mg group were a decrease in WBC, and increases in GOT, GPT, LDH and gamma-GTP (5 patients, 14.3%) whereas those in the 1.0 mg group were increases in GPT, gamma-GTP, alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin (1 patient, 3.6%). The increases in GOT and GPT were grade 2, but others were grade 1. The data show both CGS 20267 0.5 mg once daily and 1.0 mg once daily to be effective and tolerable in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.	2002
11786401	Single nucleotide polymorphism array analysis of flow-sorted epithelial cells from frozen versus fixed tissues for whole genome analysis of allelic loss in breast cancer.	Analysis of allelic loss in archival tumor specimens is constrained by quality and quantity of tissue and by technical limitations on the number of chromosomal sites that can be efficiently evaluated in conventional analyses using polymorphic microsatellite markers. Newly developed array-based assays have the potential to yield genome-wide data from small amounts of tissue but have not been validated for use with routinely processed specimens. We used the Affymetrix HuSNP assay, composed of 1494 single nucleotide polymorphism sites, to compare allelic loss results obtained from both formalin-fixed and frozen breast tissue samples. Tumor cells were separated from normal epithelia and nonepithelial cells by dissection and bivariate cytokeratin/DNA flow sorting; normal breast cells from the same patient served as constitutive normal. Allele results from the HuSNP array averaged 96% reproducibility between duplicates and were concordant between the fixed and frozen normal samples. We also analyzed DNA from the same samples after whole-genome amplification (primer extension preamplification). Although overall signal intensities were lower, the genotype data from the primer extension preamplification material was concordant with genomic DNA data from the same samples. Results from genomic normal tissue DNA averaged informative single nucleotide polymorphism at 379 (25%) loci genome-wide. Although data points were clustered and some segments of chromosomes were not informative, our data indicated that the Affymetrix HuSNP assay could provide an efficient and valid genome-wide analysis of allelic imbalance in routinely processed and whole genome-amplified pathology specimens.	2002
11535719	Noise reduction in oncology FDG PET images by iterative reconstruction: a quantitative assessment.	Tumor detection depends on the contrast between tumor activity and background activity and on the image noise in these 2 regions. The lower the image noise, the easier the tumor detection. Tumor activity contrast is determined by physiology. Noise, however, is affected by many factors, including the choice of reconstruction algorithm. Previous simulation and phantom measurements indicated that the ordered-subset expectation maximization (OSEM) algorithm may produce less noisy images than does the usual filtered backprojection (FBP) method, at equivalent resolution. To see if this prediction would hold in actual clinical situations, we quantified noise in clinical images reconstructed with both OSEM and FBP.	Three patients (2 with colon cancer, 1 with breast cancer) were imaged with FDG PET using a "gated replicate" technique that permitted accurate measurement of noise at each pixel. Each static image was acquired as a gated image sequence, using a pulse generator with a 1-s period, yielding 40 replicate images over the 10- to 15-min imaging time. The images were or were not precorrected for attenuation and were reconstructed with both FBP and OSEM at comparable resolution. From these data, images of pixel mean, SD, and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) could be produced, reflecting only noise caused by the statistical fluctuations in the emission process.	Noise did not vary greatly over each FBP image, even when image intensity varied greatly from one region to the next, causing S/N to be worse in low-activity regions than in high-activity regions. In contrast, OSEM had high noise in hot regions and low noise in cold regions. OSEM had a much better S/N than did FBP in cold regions of the image, such as the lungs (in the attenuation-corrected images), where improvements in S/N averaged 160%. Improvements with OSEM were less dramatic in hotter areas such as the liver (averaging 25% improvement in the attenuation-corrected images). In very hot tumors, FBP actually produced higher S/Ns than did OSEM.	We conclude that OSEM reconstruction can significantly reduce image noise, especially in relatively low-count regions. OSEM reconstruction failed to improve S/N in very hot tumors, in which S/N may already be adequate for tumor detection.	2001
11521762	Effect of blood flow, tumour and cold stress in a female breast: a novel time-accurate computer simulation.	Breast cancer is a dreadful disease among women and early detection helps in achieving a cure. The mammogram is presently the standard tool for detecting breast abnormality, but its sensitivity is lower for women with dense breasts. It has been found that women with an abnormal thermogram are at a higher risk and have a poorer prognosis. However, performing and interpreting thermograms requires meticulous training. Computer simulations can be an additional tool to help the clinician in the interpretation. In this paper, a novel and flexible finite element model of a female breast is developed. Both steady state and time-dependent solutions are obtained. Steady state solutions globally match experimental thermographic results with the proper choice of blood perfusion source terms, tissue thickness and geometric scaling factor. Although the simulations may not be useful in providing a unique solution (i.e. exact size and location of the tumour owing to the complex physiological relationship between the tumour and the breast surface temperature), it would nevertheless help in the 'analysis by elimination'. An example of this type of analysis is also presented.	2001
11518647	Development of a Tc-99m labeled sigma-2 receptor-specific ligand as a potential breast tumor imaging agent.	A novel in vivo imaging agent, 99mTc labeled [(N-[2-((3'-N'-propyl-[3,3,1]aza-bicyclononan-3alpha-yl)(2"-methoxy-5-methyl-phenylcarbamate)(2-mercaptoethyl)amino)acetyl]-2-aminoethanethiolato] technetium(V) oxide), [99mTc]2, displaying specific binding towards sigma-2 receptors was prepared and characterized. In vitro binding assays showed that the rhenium surrogate of [99mTc]2, Re-2, displayed excellent binding affinity and selectivity towards sigma-2 receptors (K(i) = 2,723 and 22 nM for sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptor, respectively). Preparation of [99mTc]2 was achieved by heating the S-protected starting material, 1, in the presence of acid, reducing agent (stannous glucoheptonate) and sodium [99mTc]pertechnetate. The lipophilic racemic mixture was successfully prepared in 10 to 50% yield and the radiochemical purity was >98%. Separation of the isomers, peak A and peak B, was successfully achieved by using a chiralpak AD column eluted with an isocratic solvent (n-hexane/isopropanol; 3:1; v/v). The peak A and peak B appear to co-elute with the isomers of the surrogate, Re-2, under the same HPLC condition. Biodistribution studies in tumor bearing mice (mouse mammary adenocarcinoma, cell line 66, which is known to over-express sigma-2 receptors) showed that the racemic [99mTc]2 localized in the tumor. Uptake in the tumor was 2.11, 1.30 and 1.11 %dose/gram at 1, 4 and 8 hr post iv injection, respectively, suggesting good uptake and retention in the tumor cells. The tumor uptake was significantly, but incompletely, blocked (about 25-30% blockage) by co-injection of "cold" (+)pentazocine or haloperidol (1 mg/Kg). A majority of the radioactivity localized in the tumor tissue was extractable (>60%), and the HPLC analysis showed that it is the original compound, racemic [99mTc]2 (>98% pure). The distribution of the purified peak A and peak B was determined in the same tumor bearing mice at 4 hr post iv injection. The tumor uptake was similar for both isomers, but the blood and peripheral tissue content for the isomer in peak B was higher than that for the isomer in peak A. It is evident that the isomer in peak A displayed significantly better tumor/blood and tumor/muscle ratios. The higher rate of in vivo metabolism was also confirmed by the higher thyroid uptake values for the isomer in peak B as compared to peak A. In summary, a 99mTc-labeled sigma receptor imaging agent, [99mTc]2, has demonstrated the feasibility of using a 99mTc-labeled agent for imaging sigma receptor expression in tumor cells. This is the first time a subtype-selective 99mTc-labeled agent for imaging sigma receptor sites is reported.	2001
11458523	Dendritic cell-based vaccines in patients with hematological malignancies.	The epithelial mucin MUC1 is overexpressed on many epithelial malignancies as well as on some B-cell lymphomas and multiple myelomas. In the present study, we described MUC1 expression also on primary AML blasts. To analyze the presentation of MUC1-derived HLA-A2 restricted peptides by primary AML blasts, we induced MUC1-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) in vitro using peptide pulsed dendritic cells from HLA-A2+ healthy donors as antigen-presenting cells. These CTLs efficiently lysed primary AML blasts that constitutively expressed both MUC1 and HLA-A2. The specificity of the CTLs was confirmed in a cold target inhibition assay. Our data demonstrate that MUC1-derived peptides are tumor antigens in AML which could potentially be used for immunotherapeutic approaches.	2001
11290887	F-18 FDG positron emission tomography in primary breast non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.	A 50-year-old woman had an irregular, mobile, firm right breast mass that became progressively larger in the past 3 months that measured 18 x 15 cm at the time of examination. She had no nipple discharge or skin changes. A 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) showed a ring-shaped breast uptake consisting of high peripheral glycolytic activity and a cold center most likely representing necrosis or hemorrhage despite the absence of a history of trauma, surgical intervention, chemotherapy, or radiation to the breast. Whole-body images did not show any evidence of lymph node involvement or distant metastases. These results were confirmed by computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Cytologic examination of a fine-needle aspiration of the breast mass showed diffuse large B-cell, intermediate grade, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Although it occurs infrequently, primary breast lymphoma should be considered in patients with a breast mass that shows a ring-shaped FDG uptake. A PET scan, in contrast to other imagining techniques, offers the advantage of screening the entire body, excluding the presence of metastases, and confirming the primary origin of the breast lymphoma.	2001
11237697	Purification and characterization of human cell--cell adhesion molecule 1 (C-CAM1) expressed in insect cells.	The cell--cell adhesion molecule 1 (C-CAM1) plays an important role as a tumor suppressor for prostate cancer. Decreased expression of C-CAM1 was detected in prostate, breast, and colon carcinoma. Reexpression of C-CAM1 in prostate and breast cancer cell lines was able to suppress tumorigenicity in vivo. These observations suggest that C-CAM1 may be used as a marker for cancer detection or diagnosis. To generate monoclonal antibodies specific to C-CAM1, we have overexpressed full-length human C-CAM1 in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system. The protein was purified 104-fold using nickel affinity chromatography. About 0.4 mg purified C-CAM1 was obtained from 200 mg of infected cells. When the purified protein was digested with peptidyl-N-glycosidase, the apparent mobility of the protein on SDS--PAGE changed from 90 to 58 kDa, which is close to the molecular weight predicted from the cloned cDNA sequence. This observation suggests that C-CAM1 was glycosylated on asparagine residues when expressed in Sf9 cells. Western blotting and internal protein sequencing analysis confirmed that the purified protein is human C-CAM1. Biochemical and functional assays indicate that this protein expressed in Sf9 cells displays characteristics similar to those of native protein, including adhesion function and glycosylation modification. Using this protocol, sufficient quantity of this protein can be produced with purity suitable for monoclonal antibody generation and biochemical study.	2001
11237123	In vitro-activated human lupus T cells express normal estrogen receptor proteins which bind to the estrogen response element.	We have shown that estrogen receptor (ERalpha, ERbeta) transcripts are expressed in SLE and normal T cells. In this study, T cell nuclear extracts from female lupus patients and normal donors were tested for biologically active ER proteins capable of binding to the human estrogen response element (hERE) by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. When peripheral blood T cells were stimulated with 17beta-estradiol (E2), PMA and ionomycin, two major retarded bands in T cell nuclear extracts exhibited a migration pattern similar to slow migrating protein-ERE complexes in human breast cancer cell extracts. T cells cultured only with E2 did not have these complexes. The formation of the complexes was inhibited by competition with the hERE cold oligonucleotide and partially with anti-ERalpha antibodies. There was no notable difference in the migration pattern of ERE-binding proteins between the SLE and normal T cell extracts. Together, these results suggest that activated human T cells, whether lupus-derived or normal-derived, contain biologically active ERalpha proteins. Other factors may be responsible for differential sensitivity of lupus T cells to estrogen.	2001
11131644	Effect of hypothermic irradiation of the growth characteristics of two human cell lines.	The effect of hypothermic irradiation on the growth characteristics of two human cell lines was investigated. Low temperature (2 degrees C) X-irradiation of MCF-7 cells (2, 3 and 4 Gy) resulted in higher surviving fractions compared to irradiation at 37 degrees C as assessed by the colony forming assay. The ratios for the surviving fraction between the two temperatures were 1.2, 1.5 and 1.7 at 2, 3 and 4 Gy, respectively. Correspondingly, the dose modifying factor was 1.23. The distribution of colony sizes (of those with more than 50 cells) was different with proportionally more small-sized colonies from cells irradiated at 2 degrees C. Colonies from diploid fibroblasts (HS27) were ill-defined and could not be counted. In conclusion, hypothermia during irradiation seems to influence the radioresponse in MCF-7 cells. The growth in multiwell plates of MCF-7 cells and human diploid fibroblasts (HS27) after irradiation with 3 and 4 Gy, respectively, at 2 degrees C or 37 degrees C was assessed by using the crystal violet growth assay. No difference between 2 degrees C or 37 degrees C irradiation was found for either of the two cell lines.
11085998	Caspases disrupt the nuclear-cytoplasmic barrier.	During apoptosis, caspases, a family of proteases, disassemble a cell by cleaving a set of proteins. Caspase-3 plays a major role in the dissassembly of the nucleus by processing several nuclear substrates. The question is how caspase-3 which is usually cytoplasmic, gains access to its nuclear targets. It was suggested that caspase-3 is actively transported to the nucleus through the nuclear pores. We found that caspase-9, which is activated earlier than caspase-3, directly or indirectly inactivates nuclear transport and increases the diffusion limit of the nuclear pores. This increase allows caspase-3 and other molecules that could not pass through the nuclear pores in living cells to enter or leave the nucleus during apoptosis by diffusion. Hence, caspase-9 contributes to cell disassembly by disrupting the nuclear cytoplasmic barrier.	2000
11076858	Detecting gene copy number fluctuations in tumor cells by microarray analysis of genomic representations.	In this work, we explore the use of representations in conjunction with DNA microarray technology to measure gene copy number changes in cancer. We demonstrate that arrays of DNA probes derived from low-complexity representations can be used to detect amplifications, deletions, and polymorphic differences when hybridized to representations of genomic DNA. The method is both reproducible and verifiable, and is applicable even to microscopic amounts of primary tumors. We also present a mathematical model for array performance that is useful for designing and understanding DNA microarray hybridization protocols. The future applications and challenges of this approach are discussed.	2000

11030375	Symptoms suggestive of atopic rhinitis in children aged 6-9 years and the indoor environment.	We aimed to investigate the influence of indoor factors on the prevalence of symptoms suggestive of atopic rhinitis in children aged 6-9 years in Upper Austria.	We analyzed the results from an extended ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) questionnaire, answered by the parents, about indoor environment and symptoms strongly suggesting atopic rhinitis. This was defined as having reported a running, obstructed, or itchy nose apart from having a cold in the last year. The overall response rate was 93.4%. After excluding 6,016 children (17.1%) with changed indoor environment (due to allergies in the family), we analyzed the remaining subsample of 18,606 questionnaires.	The following factors were associated with an increased risk: mother's smoking during pregnancy and/or during time of breast-feeding (OR 1.28; CI 1.07-1.52), synthetic bedding (OR 1.21; CI 1.09-1.36), dampness/mold at home (OR 1.51; CI 1.31-1.74), central heating with gas (OR 1.75; CI 1.06-2.87), and space heating (OR 1.66; CI 1.01-2.98). Cooking with wood (OR 0.62; CI 0.46-0.84) was negatively associated with symptoms.	The indoor environment plays a role in the symptoms of atopic rhinitis in children. However, the population-attributable risks were not particularly high; they were between -2.7% and 9% for the various exposures considered in this study.	2000
11029803	Determination of optimal radiation energy for different breast sizes using CT-simulator [correction of simulatior] in tangential breast irradiation.	The purpose of this study is to determine and recommend the optimal radiation source according to breast size for tangential irradiation in breast conserving therapy.	Twenty-eight patients treated at our department from January 1994 to January 1996 were studied. The dose distribution within the irradiated breast was calculated using a (60)Co-gamma ray and 6 MV-X ray. Then we compared 3-D dose distributions of the (60)Co-gamma ray and 6 MV-X ray in different-sized breasts. Three parameters (breast volume, chest wall separation, and breast height) were adopted as representative of breast size. We also examined correlations among the three parameters.	When the breast size was large (breast volume >400 cm(3), chest wall separation > 19.5 cm, or breast height > 6.5 cm), the average volume of normal tissue which received more than 110% of the isocenter dose ("hot spot") was significantly greater with the (60)Co-gamma ray than with the 6 MV-X ray (p < 0.05). A similar result was obtained with regard to hot spots in the clinical target volume. The cold area that received less than 95% of the isocenter dose was greater using a 6 MV-X ray when the breast size was small (breast volume <200 cm(3), chest wall separation <17.5 cm, or breast height <5.0 cm). However, the difference was not significant. There was a significant correlation between breast volume and chest wall separation (r =0.849, p <0.001). Breast volume and breast height were also significantly correlated (r =0.813, p <0.001).	Since breast volume and shape are different in each patient, the optimal energy should be selected for each case to obtain uniform dose distribution in breast-conserving therapy. Chest wall separation or breast height, which are measurable without a 3-D planning system, can substitute for breast volume as parameters for breast size. We recommend that the (60)Co-gamma ray not be used for treating large breasts, those with chest wall separation > or =19.5 cm or breast height > or =6.5 cm.	2000
10963907	Psychophysical examination in patients with post-mastectomy pain.	Chronic pain, lymphoedema, post-irradiation neuropathy and other symptoms are reported in as many as 75% of women following breast cancer treatment. This study examined pain and sensory abnormalities in women following breast cancer surgery. Sensory tests were carried out on operated and contralateral sides in 15 women with spontaneous pain and sensory abnormalities and 11 pain-free women. Testing included the VAS score of spontaneous pain, detection and pain threshold to thermal and mechanical stimuli, temporal summation to repetitive heat and pinprick stimuli, and assessment of skin blood flow during repetitive brush and pinprick stimulation. Sensory threshold to pinprick and thermal stimuli was significantly higher on the operated side in both groups while pressure pain threshold was significantly lower in pain patients on the operated side compared to the contralateral side. No side to side difference was seen in pressure pain threshold in the pain-free group. Evoked pain intensity to repetitive stimuli at 0.2 and 2.0 Hz was significantly higher on the operated side in pain patients compared to the control area while no such difference was seen in pain-free patients. Cutaneous blood flow measured by laser Doppler (flux) was significantly higher when the skin was tapped at 2.0 Hz on the operated side compared to contralaterally in pain patients, while no side to side difference was seen in pain-free patients. Pinprick-evoked pain was correlated to spontaneous pain but not to flux. Spontaneous pain was not correlated to flux. Sensitization seems to be a feature in breast cancer-operated women with pain, but not in pain-free women.	2000
10942395	Immunity to WT1 in the animal model and in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.	The Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene participates in leukemogenesis and is overexpressed in most types of leukemia in humans. WT1 is also detectable in many types of lung, thyroid, breast, testicular, and ovarian cancers and melanoma in humans. Initial studies evaluated whether immune responses to murine WT1 can be elicited in mice. Murine and human WT1 are similar. Thus, mouse models might lead to resolution of many of the critical issues for developing WT1 vaccines. C57/BL6 (B6) mice were injected with synthetic peptides from the natural sequence of WT1 containing motifs for binding to major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules. Immunization induced helper T-cell responses specific for the immunizing WT1 peptides and antibody responses specific for WT1 protein. Screening of multiple murine cancer cell lines identified 2 murine cancers, TRAMP-C and BLKSV40, that "naturally" overexpress WT1. Immunization with MHC class I binding peptides induced WT1 peptide-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) that specifically lysed TRAMP-C and BLKSV40. WT1 specificity of lysis was confirmed by cold target inhibition. No toxicity was noted by histopathologic evaluation in the WT1 peptide-immunized animals. WT1 peptide immunization did not show any effect on TRAMP-C tumor growth in vivo. Immunization of B6 mice to syngeneic TRAMP-C elicited WT1-specific antibody, demonstrating that WT1 can be immunogenic in the context of cancer cells. To evaluate whether WT1 might be similarly immunogenic in humans, serum from patients with leukemia was evaluated for pre-existing antibody responses. Western blot analyses showed WT1-specific antibodies directed against the N-terminus portion of the WT1 protein in the sera of 3 of 18 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

10897039	HER-2/neu is expressed in human renal cell carcinoma at heterogeneous levels independently of tumor grading and staging and can be recognized by HLA-A2.1-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes.	The HER-2/neu oncoprotein, a 185 kDa membrane-associated tyrosine kinase with extensive homology to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), is overexpressed in breast and ovarian carcinomas. Its overexpression is closely associated with poor prognosis in the course of disease. Here we demonstrate HER-2/neu overexpression in both established cell lines and biopsy material obtained from renal epithelial tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis of human kidney tumor lesions using 2 HER-2/neu-specific antibodies revealed HER-2/neu expression in more than 40% of primary epithelial renal tumors and more than 30% of primary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) specimens. A distinctive HER-2/neu expression pattern was found in different subtypes of kidney tumors with the highest frequency in chromophilic and chromophobic RCC, but neither associated with disease stage nor tumor grade. Eight of 10 RCC cell lines expressed significant levels of HER-2/neu mRNA and protein, but at a lower level compared with HER-2/neu overexpressing ovarian carcinoma cells. To evaluate the immune response against HER-2/neu expressing HLA-A2-positive (HLA-A2(+)) RCC cells, allogeneic HLA-A2-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) lines generated by pulsing dendritic cells with 3 different HER-2/neu-derived peptides, (HER-2(9.369), HER-2(9.435) and HER-2(9.689), were utilized in chromium-release assays. Specific lysis of HER-2/neu expressing HLA-A2(+) RCC cell lines was mediated by CTL lines specific for each of these 3 HER-2/neu-derived epitopes. The fine specificity of 2 CTL clones was defined to the epitopes HER-2(9.435) and HER-2(9.689). Their specificity was then confirmed by cold target inhibition assays. In addition, CTL-mediated lysis was enhanced by pulsing tumor cells with exogenous HER-2/neu-specific peptides. Our data suggest that (i) HER-2/neu is heterogeneously expressed in different subtypes of RCC, (ii) HER-2/neu is naturally processed by RCC and (iii) HER-2/neu epitopes presented by RCC can be recognized by HLA-A2-restricted, HER-2/neu-specific CTL.	2000
10851435	99mTc-ethylenedicysteine-folate: a new tumor imaging agent. Synthesis, labeling and evaluation in animals.	It is known that membrane folic acid receptors are responsible for cellular accumulation of folate and folate analogs such as methotrexate and overexpressed on various tumor cells. However, these receptors are highly restricted in normal differentiated tissues. Results of limited in vitro and in vivo animal studies suggest that folate receptors could be a potential target for tumor imaging. This study aimed to develop a 99mTc-labeled folic acid using ethylenedicysteine (EC) as a chelator and evaluate its labeling efficiency and potential use as a tumor seeking agent. Tissue distribution of 99mTc-EC-folate was determined in breast tumor-bearing rats at 20 min, 1, 2, and 4 h (n = 3/time interval, 370 KBq/rat, i.v.). Blocking study was employed to determine receptor-mediated process; 99mTc-EC-folate was co-administrated with 50 and 150 mumol/kg of cold folic acid to tumor-bearing rats. Planar imaging and whole-body autoradiograms were performed. The data was compared to that using 99mTc-EC (control). In animal studies, tumor/blood count density ratios at 20 min-4 h increased from 0.81 +/- 0.09 to 1.23 +/- 0.13 with 99mTc-EC-folate. Conversely, these values showed time-dependent decrease from 0.77 +/- 0.32 to 0.65 +/- 0.01 with 99mTc-EC in the same time period. Tumor/muscle and tumor/blood count density ratios significantly decreased with folic acid co-administrations. Planar images and autoradiograms confirmed that the tumors could be visualized clearly with 99mTc-EC-folate.	1998
10850353	Imaging tumor folate receptors using 111In-DTPA-methotrexate.	It is known that membrane folic acid receptors are responsible for cellular accumulation of folate and folate analogs, such as methotrexate, and overexpressed on various tumor cells. This study was aimed to develop an 111In labelled DTPA-methotrexate (DTPA-MTX) to image tumor folate receptors in vivo. DTPA-MTX was synthesized by reacting ethylenediamine with MTX. The resulting amino analogue of MTX was reacted with DTPA dianhydride in basic aqueous solution followed by dialysis. Tissue distribution was determined in breast tumor-bearing rats at 0.5, 2, 24, and 48 h (n = 3/time interval). To determine receptor-mediated process 111In-DTPA-MTX was co-administrated with varying blocking doses of cold folate to tumor-bearing rats. Planar imaging and whole-body autoradiograms were performed. The data was compared to that using 111In-DTPA. In animal studies, tumor/blood count density ratios at 0.5-48 h gradually increased from 0.8 +/- 0.32 to 2.2 +/- 0.41 with 111In-DTPA-MTX. Conversely, these values showed time-dependent decrease from 1.19 +/- 0.69 to 0.56 +/- 0.10 with 111In-DTPA in the same time period. Tumor/muscle and tumor/blood count density ratios significantly decreased with high doses of folic acid co-administration. Planar images and autoradiograms confirmed that the tumors could be visualized acceptably with 111In-DTPA-MTX. The results indicate the feasibility of using 111In-DTPA-MTX to image tumors through a folate receptor-mediated process.	1998
10821648	Biodistribution and radioimmunotherapy of human breast cancer xenografts with radiometal-labeled DOTA conjugated anti-HER2/neu antibody 4D5.	HER2/neu oncogene encodes a 185 kDa trans-membrane protein which is overexpressed in 20-30% of breast and ovarian cancers and portends a poor prognosis. We have studied the targeting and therapy of this oncoprotein with 4D5, a murine monoclonal antibody which recognizes a distinct epitope on the extracelluar domain of HER2/neu. We conjugated the antibody with an active ester of the macrocyclic chelating agent DOTA, radiolabeled the conjugate with either (111)In or (90)Y, and studied the antibody distribution and therapy, respectively, in athymic mice bearing xenografts of MCF7/HER2/neu, a human breast cancer cell line transfected with the HER2/neu oncogene. For the biodistribution of (111)In-labeled DOTA-4D5, a high specificity of tumor localization (30% ID/g) was seen with a tumor-to-blood ratio of greater than 2 at 48 h postinjection. Compared to a previously published study with (125)I-labeled 4D5 in beige nude mice bearing NIH3T3/HER2/neu xenografts [De Santes et al. (1992) Cancer Res. 52, 1916-1923], (111)In-labeled 4D5 antibody gave superior antibody uptake in tumor (30% ID/g vs 17% ID/g at 48h). In the therapy study, treatment of the nude mice bearing MCF7/HER2/neu xenografts with 100 microCi (3 microg) of (90)Y-labeled DOTA-4D5 caused a 3-fold reduction of tumor growth compared to untreated controls (injected with human serum albumin) in 40 days. Treatment of animals with 100 microCi of nonspecific antibody (90)Y-labeled DOTA-Leu16 (3 microg) had no tumor growth inhibition. Treatment with unlabeled DOTA-4D5 (3 microg) had a slight effect on tumor growth compared to untreated controls. When analyzed at the level of single animals, no effect was seen in seven of nine animals; however, in two of the animals, tumor growth inhibition was observed. Although a cold antibody therapeutic effect was unexpected at this dose level (3 microg), it may be possible that in some animals that 3 microg of antibody of (90)Y-labeled DOTA-4D5 augmented tumor growth reduction. To further explore the effects of cold antibody treatment alone, animals were treated with 100 or 400 microg of unlabeled 4D5 administered in two doses. These animals showed a 1.7-1.8-fold reduction in tumor growth over 28 days, a result less than that obtained with RIT only.
10719813	Detecting p53 gene mutation of breast cancer and defining differences between silver staining PCR-SSCP and immunohistochemical staining.	This study detects and defines the patterns of p53 gene mutations in breast cancers. We analyse p53 gene mutations through comparing the results of single-strand-conformation-polymorphism (SSCP) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and we try to define the differences between the results of SSCP and IHC. Twenty-seven fresh primary breast cancer tissues and eight normal breast tissues were studied. The IHC was done with the usual streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complement method by using monoclonal antibody DO-7. The results of staining was scored. The SSCP method was done by using Cold SSCP Electrophoresis System. Overexpressions of p53 protein were seven (25.9%) among 27 cancer cases on IHC. Four (57.1%) of seven cases were positive in SSCP. In SSCP, the mutations were detected in 10 (37%) among 27 cancer cases. The mutations were two in exon 5, one in exon 8, and seven cases in exon 7. All of 10 mutations were proved by sequencing analysis. Of them, only four (40%) were positive in IHC. We consider the IHC as a screening method for p53 gene mutations.	2000
10674010	Tamoxifen in high-risk premenopausal women with primary breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. Report from the Danish Breast Cancer co-operative Group DBCG 82B Trial.	Following modified radical mastectomy, pre- and perimenopausal (amenorrhoea for < 5 years) patients with stage II or III breast cancer received CMF (cyclophosphamide 600, methotrexate 40, 5-fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 intravenously (i.v.) every 4 weeks, 9 cycles). The effect on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of the addition of adjuvant tamoxifen (TAM) to adjuvant chemotherapy was examined by randomisation either to no additional treatment (n = 314), or concurrently TAM 30 mg daily for 1 year (n = 320). 40% had positive, 12% negative and 48% unknown receptor status. One year after surgery 21% versus 35% (CMF + TAM versus CMF) were still menstruating (P < 0.01). With a median follow-up of 12.2 years there was no difference in RFS (10-year RFS 34% versus 35%, P = 0.81) or OS (45% versus 46%, P = 0.73). In a Cox proportional hazards model, tumour size, number of metastatic lymph nodes, frequency of metastatic nodes in relation to total number of nodes removed, degree of anaplasia, age, and menostasia within the first year after operation were significant independent prognostic factors for RFS, and the same factors except age for OS. No significant interactions with TAM were seen. Thus, in this group of pre- and perimenopausal high-risk early breast cancer patients with heterogeneous receptor status given CMF i.v., concurrent TAM for 1 year did not improve the outcome. These results do not exclude that receptor positive patients may benefit from adjuvant TAM for longer periods given sequentially to chemotherapy.	1999
10667467	A new ELISA kit for measuring urinary 2-hydroxyestrone, 16alpha-hydroxyestrone, and their ratio: reproducibility, validity, and assay performance after freeze-thaw cycling and preservation by boric acid.	There is considerable controversy regarding the role of estrogen metabolites in breast cancer risk, fueled in part by the development of a rapid ELISA that is suitable for large scale investigations. An earlier version of the ELISA could detect values of the 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1) and 16alpha-hydroxyestrone (16alpha-OHE1) metabolites as low as 2 ng/ml and produce consistent results in premenopausal urines. However, reproducibility was problematic in postmenopausal urines where concentrations of these compounds are much lower. In response to our concern, a new ELISA was developed with a sensitivity of 0.625 ng/ml, which we evaluated using the same pre- and postmenopausal urine samples analyzed in the earlier ELISA. In this report, we present findings on the new kit with regard to reproducibility of the 2-OHE1 and 16alpha-OHE1 measurements, comparability of results with gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy values, and with regard to the stability of the metabolites after repeated freeze-thaw cycles and after preservation by boric acid. For the most part, we found the new ELISA to be reproducible, with assay coefficients of variation ranging from 10 to 20%, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) ranging from 80 to 95% in both the pre- and postmenopausal urines. ELISA results for 16alpha-OHE1 differed from 1 day (i.e., batch) to the next, and the absolute values of the metabolites obtained by the ELISA were consistently lower than but well correlated with those obtained by gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Values of the 2-OHE1:16alpha-OHE1 ratio also differed between the methods, but because the range of values was not large, the magnitude of these differences was not as great. For the ratio, the correlation between methods was excellent, and the ICCs were high for both groups of women. After preservation by boric acid, values of the ratio varied according to acid concentration but not in a linear fashion. Ratio values were similar in urine samples exposed to four different freeze-thaw cycle treatments, although values for all treatments were consistently lower in one batch. Because batch-to-batch variability was not negligible, it is advisable that matched cases and controls be analyzed in the same batch. Provided this is done, the relatively low assay coefficient of variation and high ICC demonstrate that the new ELISA kit can reliably measure the 2-OHE1:16alpha-OHE1 ratio and detect small case-control differences in large population-based studies, where rapid and relatively easy laboratory methods are critical.	2000
10656392	Intensity modulation for breast treatment using static multi-leaf collimators.	To achieve more uniform dose distributions in breast cancer treatment using multiple sets of multi-leaf collimator (MLC) defined fields. Dose uniformity for many breast cancer patients can be significantly improved by using two or more sets of portals and the "hot" regions of a traditional treatment can be significantly reduced.	Patients for breast cancer treatment are immobilized with alpha cradle in the traditional arm-up position and have a CT scan in the treatment position. The target volume is delineated on the 5-mm thick CT slices that are obtained from the lower neck to well below the breast target volume. Medial and lateral tangential fields at conventional gantry angles are designed with the aid of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). The MLC, without collimator rotation, is used to shape the field to spare as much lung as possible. The wedges and relative weights of the beams are optimized to provide the best dose uniformity. For the patients with large dose inhomogeneity, a second set of fields is designed. The weight of the original set of fields is reduced (usually to approximately 90%) so that the "original hot" regions receive the prescription dose; the second set of fields delivers a supplemental dose to the "cold" region, typically approximately 10% of the total dose. The second set of fields has the same beam parameters but "treat" only the part of breast tissue that is "cool." Presently, the design of the reduced field is an iterative process. The process can be extended to more than two sets of portals to obtain the desired dose uniformity.	With 3D planning and multiple MLC fields, dose uniformity in the treatment of breast patients was improved from 7%-22% to approximately 7%-15%. The volume receiving these high doses decreased significantly and shifted from the lung to the target. By keeping the gantry angles and wedges the same for the multiple fields, treatments can be delivered quickly and reliably. The internal mammary nodes (IM) can also be treated without including significant amount of lung or heart in the field.	Dose uniformity can be significantly improved by using this intensity modulation technique to treat certain breast patients. With these static MLC fields creating the intensity modulation, the dose uniformity to the breast can be significantly improved and the hot region in lung reduced. There is no increase in setup complexity. The small increase in treatment time is insignificant.	2000
10466304	[Chronological study for solitary bone metastasis in the sternum from breast cancer with bone scintigraphy].	Since breast cancer is frequently associated with bone metastasis, bone scintigraphies have been performed to determine pre-operative staging and to survey postoperative bone metastasis. The sternum, in particular, is a site at which is difficult to differentiate between benign bone disease and bone metastasis, because of varied uptake and wide individual variations. In this study, chronological bone images were scintigraphied in six cases with solitary sternal metastasis and three cases with benign bone disease including two fracture cases and one arthritis case. On bone scintigrams in which solitary sternal metastasis appeared, increased uptake was found in five cases, and photon deficiency was observed in one case. During follow-up scintigraphies, abnormal accumulations, such as hot spots and cold lesions, increased in the bone metastasis while abnormal uptake disappeared or was unchanged in the benign bone disease cases. On CT, four cases showed osteolytic change, and one exhibited osteosclerotic change. These findings indicate that sternal metastasis usually shows osteolytic change, even if a hot lesion is recognized on bone scintigraphy. In solitary sternal metastasis, for which early diagnosis is difficult, both an integrated diagnosis using other imaging techniques and chronological bone scintigraphy are important.	1999
10361595	Issues and findings in the evaluation of occupational risk among women high nickel alloys workers.	We present the mortality experience for a cohort of women (n = 2,877) from a large epidemiologic study of production and fabrication high nickel alloys workers (n = 31,165). All the plants were located within the United States and cohort eligibility required some work experience within the period of the late 1940s through the mid 1960s.	Vital status follow-up was through the end of 1988 and incorporated information from multiple sources. Cause-specific mortality was evaluated by comparing cohort mortality to the general United States female population and to local populations in geographic proximity to the plants. Relative risk estimates were determined for 62 cause of death categories using the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) and were adjusted for age, race, gender, and calendar time by the indirect method using a modified life table technique.	Relative risks for all causes (0.98), all cancers (0.90), lung cancer (1.34), and breast cancer (0.96) were nonsignificant when mortality was compared to the US female population. No relationship between mortality and length of time employed in the industry or work area was identified.	Although there were some difficulties in tracing women due to name changes, comprehensive follow-up was obtained when using multiple sources of information. Our strategy resulted in resolving vital status for over 95% of the women, which is comparable to that of the male cohort. The type of jobs and work activities differed between genders. Females were employed predominantly in two work areas (allocated services, 87%, and grinding, 46%), whereas males were employed in several work areas (allocated services, 76%, grinding, 27%, hot working, 20%, and cold working, 17%). Considerable variation was noted among the study plants with respect to the percent of female production workers in the workforce. Generally, the patterns of relative risks derived for the total cohort and various subgroups are similar across the different comparison populations. Estimated elevated risks are usually lower when cohort mortality is compared to that of local populations. No increased risks were identified for any site-specific cancers or nonmalignant causes of death.	1999
10343589	Sensory nerve repair in perforator flaps for autologous breast reconstruction: sensational or senseless?	The spontaneous return of sensation in autologously reconstructed breasts, especially in the Transverse Rectus Abdominis Myocutaneous (TRAM) flap, generated the belief that sensory reinnervation by nerve repair of the flap would be superfluous. This study compares the sensation of the following non-reconstructed and reconstructed breasts: (1) non-operated breasts; (2) flaps of patients reconstructed with the Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap with sensory nerve repair; (3) flaps of patients reconstructed with the Deep Inferior Epigastric Perforator (DIEP) flap without nerve repair; and (4) flaps of patients reconstructed with the free TRAM flap without nerve repair. Statistically significant lower pressure thresholds were found for DIEP flaps with nerve repair through Semmes-Weinstein testing. More segments of the DIEP flaps with nerve repair reacted to cold, warm and vibratory stimuli compared to flaps without nerve repair. Delayed but satisfactory sensory evoked potential responses were obtained for all reconstructed breasts, but in 46% of TRAM flaps no response could be registered compared with 23% and 0% for DIEP flaps without and with nerve repair, respectively. Questionnaires confirmed the objective data and showed return of erogenous sensation in 30% of the patients with DIEP flaps with nerve repair. Our data reconfirm the possibility of spontaneous return of sensation in pedicled and/or free lower abdominal flaps without nerve repair. Nerve repair in free DIEP flaps nevertheless does restore sensation earlier postoperatively, increases the quality and quantity of sensation in the flap and has a higher chance of providing erogenous sensation. The benefits obtained outweigh the disadvantages of the increased operating time.	1999
10328231	Anti-proliferative effect of radiolabelled octreotide in a metastases model in rat liver.	Most neuroendocrine tumours and several other tumours, such as breast carcinoma and malignant lymphoma, express somatostatin receptors (SS-Rs). Lesions expressing these receptors can be visualised by receptor scintigraphy using a low radioactive dose of the radiolabelled SS analogue [111In-DTPA0]octreotide. This radioligand is internalised and transported to the lysosomes with a long residence time of 111In. The aim of this experimental study in rats was to investigate whether the same agent, given in a high radioactive dose, can be used for therapy of hepatic metastases of different tumour cell lines. The development of hepatic metastases was determined 21 days after direct injection of SS-R-positive or -negative tumour cells into the vena porta in rats. On day 1 and/or 8, animals were treated with 370 MBq (0.5 microg) [111In-DTPA0]octreotide. In one experiment, using SS-R-positive tumour cells, animals were pre-treated with a high dose of cold octreotide to block the SS-R by saturation. The number of SS-R-positive liver metastases was significantly decreased after treatment with [111In-DTPA0]octreotide. Blocking the SS-R by octreotide substantially decreased the efficacy of treatment with [111In-DTPA0]octreotide, suggesting that the presence of SS-R is mandatory. This was confirmed by the finding that the number of SS-R-negative liver metastases was not affected by treatment with [111In-DTPA0]octreotide. Therefore, we conclude that (i) high radioactive doses of [111In-DTPA0]octreotide for PRRT (peptide receptor radionuclide therapy) can inhibit the growth of SS-R-positive liver metastases in an animal model, (ii) PRRT is effective only if SS-Rs are present on the tumours, (iii) the effect of PRRT with [111In-DTPA0]octreotide can be reduced by pre-treatment with cold octreotide, which indicates that receptor binding is essential for PRRT. Our data suggest that PRRT with radiolabelled octreotide might be a new promising treatment modality for SS-R-positive tumours.	1999
10326796	Effect of thermal variables on human breast cancer in cryosurgery.	There is a growing interest in the use of cryosurgery to treat breast cancer, following recent breakthroughs in noninvasive imaging and in cryotechnology, as well as the recent success of cryosurgery in treating various types of cancer. However, since haphazard freezing does not guarantee tissue destruction, in order to apply this technique effectively it is essential to determine the thermal parameters that produce complete destruction of malignant tissue. This study seeks to quantitatively identify the relationship between thermal variables and the degree of freezing damage to human breast cancer cells. In order to do this, human breast cancer and normal cells were frozen with controlled thermal parameters using a directional solidification apparatus. Cell viability was determined after thawing using trypan blue, and correlated to the thermal variables used during freezing. Cellular damage is observed to increase with increasing cooling rates, due to the higher probability of intracellular ice formation. A double freeze thaw cycle significantly increases the extent of cell damage, and is sufficient to ensure complete cell destruction at final freezing temperatures of -40 degrees C for a 25 degrees C/min cooling rate, and -20 degrees C for a 50 degrees C/min cooling rate. The correlations between cell death and thermal parameters are qualitatively identical for all the cell types in this study, although there is some variation from one cell type to another in the overall susceptibility to freezing damage. The correlations established in this study can be used to design systematic and optimal breast cryosurgery protocols.	1999
10211786	Detection of surface antigen 17-1A in breast and colorectal cancer.	Substantial progress has been made in detecting cell surface or intracytoplasmatic antigens to identify spread tumor cells with monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). The 17-1A antigen is already used as a target for specific immunotherapy in colorectal cancer. The purpose of this study was to compare the expression of 17-1A antigen in colorectal tumors versus breast cancers. MAb against the epithelial-specific antigen (ESA) and a routine staining technique were used to detect the 17-1A antigen in 100 cases of colorectal and 111 cases of breast cancer. The antigen expression of each tumor entity was examined by light microscopy on paraffin sections. Thirty six of the formalin-fixed paraffin sections of breast cancer were compared with their corresponding frozen sections. Evaluation was realized by a histological score (grade 0-9) considering the distribution and the staining intensity. We found an antigen expression of 17-1A in colorectal cancer quantified at 7.1+/-1.8 and at 4.5+/-2.5 for breast cancer in our score. Comparing paraffin sections and frozen sections in the 36 cases of breast cancer, the score was 5.5+/-2.3 in the paraffin and 8.1+/-1.9 in the frozen section group. Our results confirmed the high expression of 17-1A cases of in colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, 17-1A is expressed in the majority of breast carcinomas, revealing a high difference between paraffin and frozen sections. As a result, a specific immunotherapy with MAbs against 17-1A antigen in minimal residual stages of breast cancer might be considered.	1999
10192366	Treatment plan evaluation using dose-volume histogram (DVH) and spatial dose-volume histogram (zDVH).	The dose-volume histogram (DVH) has been accepted as a tool for treatment-plan evaluation. However, DVH lacks spatial information. A new concept, the z-dependent dose-volume histogram (zDVH), is presented as a supplement to the DVH in three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning to provide the spatial variation, as well as the size and magnitude of the different dose regions within a region of interest.	Three-dimensional dose calculations were carried out with various plans for three disease sites: lung, breast, and prostate. DVHs were calculated for the entire volume. A zDVH is defined as a differential dose-volume histogram with respect to a computed tomographic (CT) slice position. In this study, zDVHs were calculated for each CT slice in the treatment field. DVHs and zDVHs were compared.	In the irradiation of lung, DVH calculation indicated that the treatment plan satisfied the dose-volume constraint placed on the lung and zDVH of the lung revealed that a sizable fraction of the lung centered about the central axis (CAX) received a significant dose, a situation that warranted a modification of the treatment plan due to the removal of one lung. In the irradiation of breast with tangential fields, the DVH showed that about 7% of the breast volume received at least 110% of the prescribed dose (PD) and about 11% of the breast received less than 98% PD. However, the zDVHs of the breast volume in each of seven planes showed the existence of high-dose regions of 34% and 15%, respectively, of the volume in the two caudal-most planes and cold spots of about 40% in the two cephalic planes. In the treatment planning of prostate, DVHs showed that about 15% of the bladder and 40% of the rectum received 102% PD, whereas about 30% of the bladder and 50% of the rectum received the full dose. Taking into account the hollow structure of both the bladder and the rectum, the dose-surface histograms (DSH) showed larger hot-spot volume, about 37% of the bladder wall and 43% of the rectal wall. The zDVHs of the bladder revealed that the hot-spot region was superior to the central axis. The zDVHs of the rectum showed that the high-dose region was an 8-cm segment mostly superior to the central axis. The serial array-like of the rectum warrants a closer attention with regard to the complication probability of the organ.	Although DVH provides an averaged dose-volume information, zDVH provides differential dose-volume information with respect to the CT slice position. zDVH is a 2D analog of a 3D DVH and, in some situations, more superior. It provides additional information on plan evaluation that otherwise could not be appreciated. The zDVH may be used along with DVH for plan evaluation and for the correlation of radiation outcome.	1999
9873131	[Radionuclide bone scanning in patients with breast carcinoma. Study of lesions by stages, locations and diagnostic assessment].	The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic role of bone scan in patients with breast carcinoma. With this purpose, we have studied 591 patients (4 males). In 261 of them, we were able to establish the stage of disease: 33 in stage I, 137 in stage II, 71 in stage III y 20 in stage IV. Metastatic lesions were detected in 6% of patients in stage I, 8.8% in stage II, 12.7% in stage III y 50% in stage IV. Altogether, 71 from 591 patients (12%) had metastatic lesions. In 4 patients (5.3%) we obtained a false positive result. The bone lesions found in the scintigraphic studies were classified as not metastatic lesions in 236 patients (39.9%) but 26 of them were malignant (11%). Another 193 patients (32.6%) presented scintigraphic studies considered as equivocal for metastasis and 33 of them were also malignant (17%). In 150 patients scintigraphic studies did not present lesions during the follow up. In other 156 patients isolated lesions were detected and 24 of them (15.4%) were malignant. Only 4 <<cold>> lesions were detected and not any <<superscan>> image was observed in this study.	1998
9869522	Ovarian cancer-associated lymphocyte recognition of folate binding protein peptides.	Tumor-associated lymphocytes (TAL) isolated from ovarian cancer patients contain cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) capable of recognizing specific HLA/peptide complexes on tumor cells leading to tumor cell lysis. Currently, HER2/neu, overexpressed in only 30% of breast and ovarian cancers, is the only known source of CTL-recognized peptides in epithelial cancers. Therefore, we have investigated peptides derived from folate binding protein (FBP), which is over-expressed in more than 90% of ovarian cancers and in the majority of other epithelial tumors.	TAL were isolated from the malignant ascites of four consecutive HLA-A2+ ovarian cancer patients and incubated in IL-2. Initial chromium-release assays were performed within 1 week. T2 cells, incubated with peptide, were used to reconstitute T cell epitopes. The FBP sequence was interrogated for HLA-A2 binding peptides, and five were synthesized (E37-41).	Freshly cultured, unstimulated ovarian TAL recognize peptides derived from FBP. These peptides are presented in the context of HLA-A2, and are specifically recognized in a HLA class I-restricted fashion. TAL recognition of these reconstituted T cell epitopes is concentration dependent. Furthermore, the FBP peptides are shown by cold target inhibition studies to be naturally processed and presented antigens.	FBP peptides are recognized by freshly isolated TAL from ovarian cancer patients, suggesting in vivo expression and sensitization. Because FBP is over-expressed 20-fold in most adenocarcinomas, these peptides may be used in a widely applicable peptide-based vaccine for epithelial tumors.	1998
9856953	p53-independent role of MDM2 in TGF-beta1 resistance.	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) inhibits cell proliferation, and acquisition of TGF-beta resistance has been linked to tumorigenesis. A genetic screen was performed to identify complementary DNAs that abrogated TGF-beta sensitivity in mink lung epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of murine double minute 2 rescued TGF-beta-induced growth arrest in a p53-independent manner by interference with retinoblastoma susceptibility gene product (Rb)/E2F function. In human breast tumor cells, increased MDM2 expression levels correlated with TGF-beta resistance. Thus, MDM2 may confer TGF-beta resistance in a subset of tumors and may promote tumorigenesis by interference with two independent tumor suppressors, p53 and Rb.	1998
9855585	Treatment for lactation suppression: little progress in one hundred years.	Our goal was to characterize the postpartum symptoms experienced by women who do not breast-feed and to review data on the efficacy of nonpharmacologic methods of lactation suppression. The placebo arms of randomized clinical trials of pharmacologic methods for lactation suppression were used to characterize postpartum symptoms. A subset of the placebo arms was reviewed to assess current strategies for treatment of symptoms associated with lactation suppression. Studies of nonpharmacologic methods of lactation suppression were also reviewed to assess efficacy. Engorgement and breast pain may encompass most of the first postpartum week. Up to one third of women who do not breast-feed and who use a brassiere or binder, ice packs, or analgesics may experience severe breast pain. Specific studies of nonpharmacologic methods of lactation suppression were limited and inconclusive. Available data suggest that many women using currently recommended strategies for treatment of symptoms may nevertheless experience engorgement or pain for most of the first postpartum week.	1998
9853137	A phase II/III clinical study of tin ethyl etiopurpurin (Purlytin)-induced photodynamic therapy for the treatment of recurrent cutaneous metastatic breast cancer.	Chest wall recurrence of breast cancer after mastectomy, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy poses a therapeutic dilemma. Further intervention with any or all of these modalities is often futile and morbid. Left untreated, severe pain, infection, and suffering occur.	To ascertain whether photodynamic therapy may present a palliative option for these individuals.	A total of 86 lesions (2.4-cm mean diameter) were treated on eight patients who had biopsy-proven chest wall recurrence despite surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Each patient underwent a single photodynamic therapy session in which 1.2 mg/kg of the drug tin ethyl etiopurpurin (Purlytin) was injected and followed 24 hours later by laser light treatment at 660 +/- 3 nm (at 150 mW/cm2 for a total light dose of 200 J/cm2).	With a minimum 6-month follow-up, the objective response rates after photodynamic therapy were complete response, 92%; partial response, 8%; and no response, 0%. Lesions less than 0.5 cm had a 100% complete response. Morbidity was minimal with no systemic toxicity. One patient had a wound infection that responded to oral antibiotics. No photosensitivity reactions were reported in this set of patients. Posttreatment pain was reported and could be treated with medication and application of cold compresses.	Photodynamic therapy offers an excellent local control rate of chest wall recurrence with minimal morbidity after multimodality treatment failure. The treatment is given in a single session and on an outpatient basis. In patients who may register a partial response or have recurrence or the incidence of further chest wall nodules after photodynamic therapy, the treatment is repeatable.
9849474	A woman's build and the risk of breast cancer.	A woman's build and the risk of breast cancer seem to be related. While relative overweight, as described by the body mass index, seems to be associated with increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women, overweight in premenopausal women seems slightly protective. Papers from a MEDLINE search are reviewed regarding the association between build and the development of breast cancer. Different aspects of build, such as height, weight, body mass index and body shape, are discussed. The more prominent associations found through this search are a positive association between height and breast cancer risk both in pre- and postmenopausal women. Regarding body mass index, the association is negative in premenopausal women and positive in postmenopausal women. Body shape described as masculine versus feminine seems to have no impact on breast cancer risk in premenopausal women, but seems to be positively associated with breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Possible biological mechanisms responsible for the associations with breast cancer risk are discussed, including endogenous oestrogens, androgens and glucose metabolic substances. Avoiding or reducing postmenopausal overweight may modify breast cancer risk indicators in a more favourable direction.	1998
9735983	F-18 FDG whole-body positron emission tomography scan in primary breast sarcoma.	Three patients with primary breast sarcoma showed intense F-18 FDG breast uptake on the whole-body scan. In two patients the uptake was irregular and associated with cold foci that corresponded to hypodense lesions noted on the chest CT; these represented areas of pathologically demonstrated tumor necrosis. There was also intense FDG uptake in pulmonary, axillary, and supraclavicular lymph node metastases. All lesions were confirmed by CT scan of the chest. Thus F-18 FDG positron emission tomographic scanning accurately staged the tumors in these two patients, and it documented local recurrence in the third patient. Histopathologic examination showed evidence of a high-grade sarcoma, a primary rhabdomyosarcoma, and a malignant cystosarcoma phyllodes of the breast. Similar to breast carcinoma, F-18 FDG whole-body positron emission tomographic imaging could be useful in diagnosing and staging primary breast sarcomas.	1998

9533931	Congress Report: XIX symposium of the International Association for Comparative Research on Leukemia and Related Diseases, Mannheim/Heidelberg, Germany, July 13 - 18, 1997.	The XIX Symposium of the International Association for Comparative Research on Leukemia and Related Diseases (IACRLRD, President: Prof. Dr. R. Hehlmann) was held in Mannheim and Heidelberg, Germany, July 13 - 18, 1997. Comparative research in cancer was systematically established in the 1950s. Similarities in morphology, biology and pathology between animal and human leukemias and related diseases and the viral origin of a variety of animal leukemias and related diseases (lymphomas, sarcomas, breast tumors etc.) led to the concept that comparative research should promote the understanding of human leukemias and related diseases. In 1960 the World Health Organization inaugurated the establishment of a World Committee for Comparative Leukemia Research. The first symposium took place in Hannover, Germany, in 1963. After the fifth symposium in Padova, Italy, in 1971 the International Association for Comparative Research on Leukemia and Related Diseases (IACRLRD) was founded to complement the World Committee and to expand the international effort. The history of the symposium shows the evolution from a meeting on animal leukemia viruses into one dealing with viral and genetic aspects of human and animal leukemia and related diseases. The scientific evolution of the Abelson murine leukemia virus with its abl oncogene in the 1970s to what currently appears as the most reliable marker for human chronic myeloid leukemia is merely one example. Comparative research has reached a new dimension with the the recent advances in sequencing of the genomes of a variety of species and of humans. Many genes identified in the human genome and relevant for disease can be found in the genomes of animal species and even in the genomes of bacteria and of yeast. This reminds us that not just human and animal biology but also pathology must be regarded as a continuum of evolution and that much can be learned from comparing the genetic information of different species. Comparative genome research will allow conclusions to be drawn from principles recognized in animal species which are relevant to human diseases. It is likely that the application of comparative research to genome analysis will provide basic new insights in molecular medicine into the function of living beings for both animal species and humans. The current revolution in genomics is the latest phase in a rich history of medical progress related to the comparative approach. Meetings and organizations that have grown out of IACRLRD, include, at least to some extent: the Meeting of the International Human Retrovirology Association, the Gallo Lab Meeting , the Feline Retrovirus Meeting, the Cold Spring Habor Retrovirus Meeting, international and regional AIDS meetings, and many others. The XIX symposium in Mannheim included five memorial lectures, seven plenary sessions, 18 parallel sessions, two round table discussions and a public forum. In addition, six associated satellite symposia were held. The general meeting, attended by participants from 27 countries, integrated thematically contributions of genetic, cellular, and viral factors toward the development of leukemia and lymphoma and sought unifying concepts in leukemogenesis.	1998
9572622	The linear-quadratic transformation of dose-volume histograms in fractionated radiotherapy.	Dose-volume histograms (DVHs) are often used in radiotherapy to provide representations of treatment dose distributions. DVHs are computed from physical dose and do not include radiobiological factors; therefore, the same DVH will be computed for a treatment plan whatever fractionation regimen is used. However, dose heterogeneity resulting from variation of daily treatment dose within the volume will have biological effects due to spatial heterogeneity of fraction size as well as total dose. The purpose of the paper is to present a radiobiological (LQ) transformation of the physical dose distribution which incorporates fraction size effects and may be better suited to the prediction of biological effects.	An analytic formula is derived for the linear-quadratic transformation of a normal distribution of dose to give the corresponding distribution of biologically equivalent dose given as 2 Gy fractions. This allows LQ-transformed DVHs to be computed from physical DVHs. The resultant LQ-DVH depends on the assumed value of the relevant alpha/beta ratio. It is a modified dose distribution (corrected for spatial heterogeneity of fraction size) but does not incorporate time factors or volume effects.	The analysis shows that the LQ-transformed distribution is always broader than the distribution of physical dose. Radiobiological 'hot spots' and 'cold spots' are further from the mean than physical distributions would indicate. The difference between conventional DVHs and LQ-transformed DVHs is dependent on the fractionation regimen used. LQ-DVHs for a single dose distribution (treatment plan) can be computed for different fractionation regimens with some simplifying assumptions (e.g. no time-factor-dependence of late effects). Regimens calculated to be radiobiologically equivalent at a single point nevertheless result in non-equivalent LQ-DVHs when spatial variation of daily treatment dose is included. The difference is especially important for tumour sites (such as breast and head and neck) for which considerable dose heterogeneity may occur and for which different treatment regimens are in use.	LQ-DVHs should be computed in parallel with conventional DVHs and used in the evaluation of treatment plans and fractionation regimens and in the analysis of high-dose side-effects in patients.	1998

9485028	Her-2/neu-derived peptides are tumor-associated antigens expressed by human renal cell and colon carcinoma lines and are recognized by in vitro induced specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.	The Her-2/neu oncogene encodes a Mr 185,000 transmembrane protein with homology to the epidermal growth factor receptor. It is overexpressed in 30-40% of breast and ovarian cancers, and this overexpression was shown to correlate with aggressiveness of malignancy and poor prognosis. Using tumor-associated lymphocytes isolated from patients with ovarian or breast cancer, several HLA-A2-restricted, Her-2/neu-derived peptides were identified. Further studies revealed that these tumor-associated CTLs can also lyse other tumors, including non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that Her-2/neu epitopes are shared between several distinct types of epithelial tumors. To analyze whether Her-2/neu epitopes are tumor-associated antigens for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and colon carcinoma, we induced Her-2/neu peptide-specific CTL responses by primary in vitro immunization and used these CTLs to determine the presentation of Her-2/neu epitopes on human tumor lines. Autologous dendritic cells (DCs) generated from peripheral blood monocytes were pulsed with Her-2/neu-derived peptides E75 and GP2 and used as antigen-presenting cells for CTL priming. High CTL activity toward peptide-pulsed targets was obtained after two weekly restimulations. CTLs induced with DCs generated in the presence of TNF-alpha elicited a higher cytotoxic activity when they were stimulated with the cognate peptide than did CTLs induced with DCs grown in granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin 4 alone. The cytotoxicity of induced CTLs was antigen specific and HLA-A2 restricted. Furthermore, these CTLs lysed, in a MHC- and antigen-restricted fashion, not only breast cancer cells but also colon carcinoma and RCC cell lines expressing Her-2/neu. The cytotoxic activity against tumor cells was blocked by cold HLA-A2-positive targets pulsed with the cognate peptide in cold target inhibition assay and by anti-HLA-A2 monoclonal Ab. These results suggest that epitopes derived from Her-2/neu protein might be attractive candidates for broadly applicable vaccines and may prove useful for adoptive immunotherapies designed for colon carcinoma or RCC.	1998
9385957	From cadavers to implants: silicon tissue assays of medical devices.	A plethora of data has been used to condemn and defend the role of silicone and its association with "adjuvant disease." In the ongoing attempt to enhance our knowledge, we have chosen to identify tissue silicon levels in patients with saline implants or tissue expanders. We have compared these levels with tissue samples from a variety of patients with and without medicinal silicone devices from both the northeast and southwest United States over a 4-year period. All specimens were harvested by a "no touch" technique, non-formalin fixed, frozen, and shipped to an independent toxicology laboratory for analysis. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy was used to obtain the tissue silicon measurements. Silicon tissue values in cadaveric tissue (n = 20 cadavers; n = 120 specimens) averaged 2.2 mcg/gm of tissue with undetectable silicon levels in over 50 percent of the specimens (range 0 to 45 mcg/gm; median = 0). Silicon levels surrounding port-a-catheter devices (n = 15 patients; n = 15 specimens) averaged 8.04 mcg/gm of tissue (range 0 to 41 mcg/gm; median = 0). Tissue levels in the capsules surrounding saline (n = 10 patients; n = 22 specimens) and silicone implants (n = 31 patients; n = 58 specimens) averaged 292 mcg/gm (range 0 to 1380 mcg/gm; median = 110) and 1439 mcg/gm (range 0 to 9800 mcg/gm, median = 490), respectively. Tissue levels, however, from distant sites (n = 22 specimens) in these same patients were equivalent to the cadaveric nonaugmented values (average = 3.2 mcg/gm; range 0 to 5.8 mcg/gm; median = 2.7). The results imply that there is a continuum of exposure to silicone medical devices based on the mechanical properties of silicone. The data seem to suggest that there may be a progression of measurable tissue silicon levels based on the amount of environmental or device-related silicone exposure a person has over his or her lifetime. It is our hope that these levels will serve as a baseline for our continuing knowledge of implantable medical devices.	1997
9368811	Estimates of the sources of variation (variance components) of bioelectric impedance and anthropometric measurements in an epidemiological case-control study of breast cancer.	This study investigated the variability of anthropometric measurements and body fat estimated by bioelectric impedance analysis. Subsequently the methods were applied in a case-control study to investigate the association with breast cancer.	The study group included 50 consecutive cases and 75 age-matched controls from the same area. The variation was investigated in 50 healthy women from the control group, who were repeatably measured using standardised measurement procedures, and the variation between-subjects, within-subjects, between-observers, and within-observers were estimated.	The study showed that the variance components between-subjects were 64-99% of the total variance. The variables of skinfold thicknesses were characterised by having the highest relative observer variation and having many unavailable values that were out of the range of the Harpenden callipers. The mean body fat by bioelectric impedance analysis was 31.2%, and the total coefficient of variation 23%, while the variance components related to subject time, observer and measurement were 98.4%, 1.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4%, respectively. The body fat was significantly correlated with the variables of skinfold thicknesses. We decided to exclude the variables of skinfold thicknesses from the case-control study, and for the other variables to measure each subject only at one time by one observer. The case-control part of the study indicated a non-significant increase in body weight in the postmenopausal breast cancer patients (mean difference 3.6 kg; confidence interval from -0.9 kg to 8.0 kg). Similarly the body fat tended to be higher in the breast cancer patients (mean difference 1.2%; confidence interval from -1.6% to 4.0%).	1997
9361102	Modified formalin and methanol fixation methods for molecular biological and morphological analyses.	Several simplified fixation methods were examined to determine their suitability for both molecular biological analyses and morphological study. Fixation with 10% v/v formalin alone at 4 degrees C and containing 5 mmol/L ethylenediamine-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EDTA) at room temperature preserved significantly more high-molecular-weight DNA than 10% v/v formalin fixation at room temperature. The morphological differences between tissues fixed using these modified formalin fixation methods and conventional 10% v/v formalin fixation were negligible. Of the dehydration fixatives tested, 100% methanol did not cause regional differences due to artificial tissue shrinkage and the morphology of sections prepared by methanol fixation was preserved consistently better than that of acetone- or ethanol-fixed sections. All three dehydration fixatives preserved relatively higher-molecular-weight DNA and RNA, compared with formalin. Cold formalin, formalin containing EDTA at room temperature and 100% methanol are recommended as standard and additional fixatives routine clinicopathological laboratory use.	1997
9327288	Clinical manifestations and diagnostic approach to metastatic cancer of the mandible.	In a 12-month period, metastatic cancer was diagnosed in eight patients. Six of them presented with pain mimicking toothache, temporomandibular joint disorders or trigeminal neuralgia, while two showed osteopenic bone lesions in the panoramic radiography, and perimandibular swelling. Anesthesia of the lower lip was the only common clinical feature. In seven of the eight patients, a whole body bone scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the skull in combination with a whole body and SPECT anti-granulocyte (Tc-99m MAK 250/183) bone marrow scintigraphy was performed. One patient did not have combined scintigraphy performed secondary to severe systemic illness. In six of the seven, the results were conclusive for a metastatic bone lesion. Biopsies confirmed three patients to have a previously unrecognized primary cancer, one patient to have previously unrecognized recurrent cancer, and three patients to exhibit new metastatic spread of an already diagnosed cancer. Histology revealed breast, lung, renal cancer and a malignancy of inconclusive origin. In the remaining patient, combined scintigraphy suggested osteomyelitis, yet biopsy revealed a prostate cancer metastasis with acute inflammatory cell infiltration. Thus, the scintigraphy pattern of a hot spot in the bone scan and a cold lesion in the bone marrow scintigraphy is highly suggestive of a mandibular metastasis, if accompanied by anesthesia of the lower lip.	1997
9298297	Uptake of In-111 pentetreotide by normally functioning nodular goiters.	After the intravenous administration of a radiolabeled somatostatin analogue (octreotide), normal thyroid and neoplastic and nonneoplastic thyroid lesions can be visualized. The authors present the cases of two patients who underwent somatostatin receptor scintigraphy (SSRS) using In-111 pentetreotide: one for the study of suspected paraneoplastic ACTH hypersecretion, and the other for a restaging of breast carcinoma with neuroendocrine features. In both patients, SSRS revealed increased uptake in the thyroid, corresponding to "cold" nodules on Tc-99m pertechnetate imaging. Cytologic and histologic examinations showed the typical features of thyroid goiters without lymphocytic infiltration.	1997
9329619	int-2 and c-erbB-2 gene amplification detected in 70 frozen human breast carcinomas by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.	Gene amplification is a common mechanism of proto-oncogene activation and contributes to tumor progression. Analysis of such genetic alterations is relevant to our understanding of tumor genetics and can provide prognostic information for the patients. A rapid, non-radioactive approach based on qdPCR and fluorescent DNA technique was applied for determination of int-2 and c-erbB2 gene amplification and correlated with other prognostic factors in 70 breast cancer samples. ER and PgR were analysed by immunohistochemistry. The mixed template assay showed 96% concordance between calculated and measured gene copy number. int-2 gene and c-erbB2 amplification were both found in 24% of the tumors. The amplification did not correlate with any of the other prognostic factors. 8% of the tumors showed amplification of both genes without significant correlations to any of the other parameters. The fd-PCR assay is a valuable tool for determination of amplification of int-2 and c-erbB2 genes. Therefore, more detailed information about individual tumour biology and outcome may be acquired by this routine assay and probably provide prognostic impact.
9240653	Dosimetric comparison of treatment planning systems in irradiation of breast with tangential fields.	The objectives of this study are: (1) to investigate the dosimetric differences of the different treatment planning systems (TPS) in breast irradiation with tangential fields, and (2) to study the effect of beam characteristics on dose distributions in tangential breast irradiation with 6 MV linear accelerators from different manufacturers.	Nine commercial and two university-based TPS are evaluated in this study. The computed tomographic scan of three representative patients, labeled as "small", "medium" and "large" based on their respective chest wall separations in the central axis plane (CAX) were used. For each patient, the tangential fields were set up in each TPS. The CAX distribution was optimized separately with lung correction, for each TPS based on the same set of optimization conditions. The isodose distributions in two other off-axis planes, one 6 cm cephalic and the other 6 cm caudal to the CAX plane were also computed. To investigate the effect of beam characteristics on dose distributions, a three-dimensional TPS was used to calculate the isodose distributions for three different linear accelerators, the Varian Clinac 6/100, the Siemens MD2 and the Philips SL/7 for the three patients. In addition, dose distributions obtained with 6 MV X-rays from two different accelerators, the Varian Clinac 6/100 and the Varian 2100C, were compared.	For all TPS, the dose distributions in all three planes agreed qualitatively to within +/- 5% for the "small" and the "medium" patients. For the "large" patient, all TPS agreed to within +/- 4% on the CAX plane. The isodose distributions in the caudal plane differed by +/- 5% among all TPS. In the cephalic plane in which the patient separation is much larger than that in the CAX plane, six TPS correctly calculated the dose distribution showing a cold spot in the center of the breast contour. The other five TPS showed that the center of the breast received adequate dose. Isodose distributions for 6 MV X-rays from three different accelerators differed by about +/- 3% for the "small" patient and more than +/- 5% for the "large" patient. For two different 6 MV machines of the same manufacturer, the isodose distribution agreed to within +/- 2% for all three planes for the "large" patient.	The differences observed among the various TPS in this study were within +/- 5% for both the "small" and the "medium" patients while doses at the hot spot exhibit a larger variation. The large discrepancy observed in the off-axis plane for the "large" patient is largely due to the inability of most TPS to incorporate the collimator angles in the dose calculation. Only six systems involved agreed to within +/- 5% for all three patients in all calculation planes. The difference in dose distributions obtained with three accelerators from different manufacturers is probably due to the difference in beam profiles. On the other hand, the 6 MV X-rays from two different models of linear accelerators from the same manufacturer have similar beam characteristics and the dose distributions are within +/- 2% of each other throughout the breast volume. In general, multi-institutional breast treatment data can be compared within a +/- 5% accuracy.	1997
9166399	The dynamic organization of the perinucleolar compartment in the cell nucleus.	The perinucleolar compartment (PNC) is a unique nuclear structure preferentially localized at the periphery of the nucleolus. Several small RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase III (e.g., the Y RNAs, MRP RNA, and RNase P H1 RNA) and the polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB; hnRNP I) have thus far been identified in the PNC (Ghetti, A., S. PinolRoma, W.M. Michael, C. Morandi, and G. Dreyfuss. 1992. Nucleic Acids Res. 20:3671-3678; Matera, A.G., M.R. Frey, K. Margelot, and S.L. Wolin. 1995. J. Cell Biol. 129:1181-1193; Lee, B., A.G. Matera, D.C. Ward, and J. Craft. 1996. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 93: 11471-11476). In this report, we have further characterized this structure in both fixed and living cells. Detection of the PNC in a large number of human cancer and normal cells showed that PNCs are much more prevalent in cancer cells. Analysis through the cell cycle using immunolabeling with a monoclonal antibody, SH54, specifically recognizing PTB, demonstrated that the PNC dissociates at the beginning of mitosis and reforms at late telophase in the daughter nuclei. To visualize the PNC in living cells, a fusion protein between PTB and green fluorescent protein (GFP) was generated. Time lapse studies revealed that the size and shape of the PNC is dynamic over time. In addition, electron microscopic examination in optimally fixed cells revealed that the PNC is composed of multiple strands, each measuring approximately 80-180 nm diam. Some of the strands are in direct contact with the surface of the nucleolus. Furthermore, analysis of the sequence requirement for targeting PTB to the PNC using a series of deletion mutants of the GFP-PTB fusion protein showed that at least three RRMs at either the COOH or NH2 terminus are required for the fusion protein to be targeted to the PNC. This finding suggests that RNA binding may be necessary for PTB to be localized in the PNC.	1997
9184925	Cytotoxic T lymphocytes derived from bone marrow mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients recognize an underglycosylated form of MUC1 mucin.	MUC1 is a highly immunogenic epithelial mucin and serves as a tumor-associated antigen in breast, pancreatic and ovarian carcinomas. We previously reported the expression of MUC1 on myeloma cells and the establishment of an HLA-unrestricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) line TN that recognized MUC1 from peripheral blood mononuclear cells in a multiple myeloma patient. In this study, we attempted to induce such CTL from six other multiple myeloma patients consecutively in order to show that the induction of the CTL line TN had not resulted from some idiosyncrasy of the first patient. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were used to induce CTL, because they contain myeloma cells that might stimulate the autologous lymphocytes. Bulk CTL lines were induced from two out of six patients. The CTL line TS was CD8+ cell dominant and KY was CD4+ cell dominant. Both CTL lines lysed MUC1+ myeloma and breast carcinoma cell lines. The cytotoxicity of the CTL lines was inhibited by anti-CD3, anti-alpha beta TCR and anti-MUC1 mAb. It was also inhibited by a MUC1 transfectant, but not by a mock transfectant in cold target inhibition assays. MUC1 was transfected into a human colonic carcinoma cell line. The reactivity of anti-MUC1 core protein mAb and the cytotoxicity of the CTL against the transfectant was enhanced by the treatment of the cells with an O-glycosylation inhibitor. Thus it is generally accepted that the HLA-unrestricted CTL which directly recognize the underglycosylated from of MUC1 using their TCR could be induced from a certain proportion (approximately 30%) of untreated multiple myeloma patients.	1997
9202661	Interleukin-6 upregulates GP96 expression in breast cancer.	Interleukin-6 is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer. Expression of GP96, a glucose regulated stress protein, is related to drug resistance in tumor cells. Interleukin-6 has previously been shown to induce GP96 expression in a murine myeloblastic cell line. BT474 or MDA-MB231 cells were incubated with recombinant Interleukin-6 (100 to 750 U/ml) for 24 hr. To establish a time course for GP96 induction, MDA-MB231 cells were incubated with 250 U/ml recombinant interleukin-6 for 0-48 hr. Following incubation, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cell lysates were prepared by adding 100 microliters of PBS and freezing at -20 degrees C. GP96 was assessed by immunoblotting. Breast tumor tissue and histologically normal breast tissue were obtained within 1 hr of resection and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissue was homogenized in ice-cold PBS and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 300g at 4 degrees C for 5 min. Supernatants were collected and assayed for interleukin-6 by ELISA, and GP96 by immunoblotting. Both interleukin-6 (P < 0.001) and GP96 are elevated in breast tumor tissue compared to histologically normal tissue. Interleukin-6 (> or = 250 U/ml for > or = 12 hr) induces GP96 in the metastatic breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB231, but has no effect on GP96 levels in the primary cell line, BT474. Elevated interleukin-6 in breast tumors may induce GP96 expression in tumor cells conferring a survival advantage by rendering them resistant to cytotoxic therapy and other forms of stress.	1997
9056743	Comparison of five cell cycle analysis models applied to 1414 flow cytometric DNA histograms of fresh frozen breast cancer.	Conflicting prognostic results with regard to DNA flow cytometric variables have been reported for breast cancer patients. Reasons for this can be found mainly on the different levels of methodology, including the interpretation of the DNA-histograms. Several computer programs based on different fitting models are available for cell cycle analyses which result in different %S-phase calculations. The present study evaluated the influence of 5 different cell cycle analysis models on several cell cycle variables (%S-phase, %G2M-phase, %diploid cells, DNA-index, %debris) derived from flow cytometric DNA-histograms obtained from breast cancers. DNA-histograms obtained from 1414 fresh frozen breast cancers were interpreted using 5 different cell cycle analysis models using the computer program MultiCycle AV. Model 1 used the zero order S-phase calculation and "sliced nuclei" debris correction, model 2 added fixed G0/G1 and G2/M-phase ratio, and model 3 added correction for aggregates. Model 4 applied the first order S-phase calculation and sliced nuclei debris correction. Model 5 fixed the CVs of the G0/G1 and G2/M-phase in addition to applying the sliced nuclei debris correction and zero-order S-phase calculation. Using all cases, it was shown that when the aggregates correction was included (model 3) in the analysis, on average, significantly lower mean values were obtained for %S-phase cells, and %debris, and %G2M-phase cells of the first cell cycle. No significant differences were observed for the other variables. Analyzing the DNA-diploid, tetraploid, and aneuploid cases separately, similar results were obtained. Linear regression analysis showed only moderately strong correlations for the %S-phase and %G2M-phase variables between the different models, indicating that for individual DNA-histograms the cell cycle analysis results may vary. In conclusion, quite different values can be obtained for especially the %S-phase cells using different cell cycle analysis models in individual cases. Correction for aggregates results on average in significantly lower %S-phase values. This clearly has implications for comparing %S-phase results from studies using aggregate correction or not, especially with regard to prognostic thresholds. Large follow-up studies are necessary to derive at the prognostically best model.	1997
9135504	Effectiveness of cold cap in the prevention of docetaxel-induced alopecia.	Docetaxel is a new taxoid antineoplastic agent with clinical efficacy especially in breast cancer. One of the most distressing side-effects induced by docetaxel is alopecia. We studied the prevention of alopecia by using a cold cap in 98 patients receiving 100 mg/m2 docetaxel by 1 h i.v. infusion every 3 weeks. One patient was lost to follow-up. 83 patients (86%) were evaluated as a success to the cold cap, as they presented WHO grade alopecia < or = 2 and no need to wear a wig. 14 patients (14%) had to wear a wig; among them; 7 patients withdrew before the evaluation at three cycles. The cold cap is a very effective technique with minimal side-effects for docetaxel-treated patients.	1997
9076770	99Tcm-LL1: a potential new bone marrow imaging agent.	LL1, a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to HLA Class-II-like antigen (li determinant) on the surface of B-lymphocytes, monocytes and histiocytes, was evaluated as an agent for bone marrow imaging. Six patients with diverse diseases (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, n = 2; multiple myeloma, n = 1; polycythaemia vera, n = 1; lung cancer, n = 1; breast cancer, n = 1) were given low protein doses (< 1 mg) of 99Tcm (30 mCi) labelled Fab' of LL1. 99Tcm-sulphur colloid (SC) imaging was performed in three patients for comparison. Both planar and single photon emission tomographic images were acquired using Sopha gamma cameras. As early as 2 h post-MAb injection, excellent bone marrow images were achieved in all patients, demonstrating both normal or hyperproliferative marrow, as well as 'cold' bone marrow abnormalities such as radiation defects or cancer metastases. Similar to SC, relatively high uptake of LL1 was found in the liver and spleen. However, the bone marrow-to-liver and -spleen uptake ratios were approximately 19-fold higher (0.75 vs 0.04) and 6-fold higher (1.23 vs 0.22), respectively, with LL1 than with SC. The higher bone marrow uptake allowed clearly superior visualization of the thoracic spine when compared to SC. The mean T1/2 of blood and whole-body clearance were 0.4 and 66 h, respectively. The highest radiation absorbed doses (in cGy mCi-1) were observed in the spleen (0.47 +/- 0.24), kidneys (0.25 +/- 0.09) and liver (0.14 +/- 0.04). The bone marrow dose was only 0.05 +/- 0.02 cGy mCi-1. These results indicate that bone marrow imaging with 99Tcm-LL1 is feasible, and that LL1 may be a suitable alternative to SC because of better visualization of the lower thoracic spine. Potential applications include the improved detection of bone marrow metastases of solid tumours and the assessment of haematological disorders.	1997
9015534	Sensory reinnervation of autologous tissue TRAM flaps after breast reconstruction.	The use of the transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap has come to the forefront for breast reconstruction following mastectomy. Despite our ability to create surgically a supple breast mound, simulate the nipple with local skin flaps, and pigment the skin to create an areola, one of the last drawbacks has been the reestablishment of normal sensation. Some patients have anecdotally reported some sensory return in the reconstructed breast mound. We sought to quantitate the pattern of sensory return in TRAM flaps in 24 patients to identify factors that favor sensory reinnervation of the flap. Patients were recalled for sensory testing after unilateral or bilateral breast reconstruction following mastectomy for cancer or premalignant mastopathy. The interval from surgery varied from 3 to 41 months. Sensation was evaluated using the Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test, hot/cold recognition, and vibratory sensation measured in 16 segments of the reconstructed breast mound and compared to the opposite, unoperated breast or to volunteer controls. Thirty-four flaps were evaluated. The Semmes-Weinstein measurements demonstrated measurable sensation in 32 of 34 flaps with 2 flaps developing sensation equal to the control unoperated breast. The return of hot recognition occurred in 21 of 34 flaps, cold recognition in 22 of 34 flaps, and vibratory sensation in 26 of 34 flaps. Our findings suggest that excellent sensory return occurs in the majority of patients via nerve ingrowth into the flap from the mastectomy bed. It would appear that a natural breast reconstruction with some sensation can be a reality for the majority of patients in the absence of additional complex surgical maneuvers such as nerve preservation or nerve-nerve coaptation.	1997
8896925	Cold spots on bone scans in patients wearing weighted breast prostheses.	A bone scan is frequently obtained in patients with breast cancer for evaluation of possible metastatic bone disease or for evaluation of response of known metastases to treatment. These patients commonly wear breast prostheses after unilateral or bilateral mastectomies. On some bone scans, the authors have observed artifacts resulting from certain breast prostheses. In particular, in the patient described, a weighted breast prosthesis was not removed during Tc-99m HMDP bone scanning and was interpreted as being permanent pacemaker or defibrillation unit. The scintigraphic appearance of several commonly used, commercially available weighted breast prostheses is discussed.	1996
8640700	Estrogen receptor immunocytochemistry in paraffin embedded tissues with ER1D5 predicts breast cancer endocrine response more accurately than H222Sp gamma in frozen sections or cytosol-based ligand-binding assays.	Historically, estrogen receptor (ER) determinations have been made by the ligand-binding assay of tumor homogenates, primarily by the dextran-coated charcoal method (DCC). Immunocytochemical assays (ICA) for ER are more recent and have been executed mostly on frozen sections with the monoclonal antibody H222Sp gamma (H222). Lately, new monoclonal antibodies derived by recombinant ER technology have been developed that work well on paraffin embedded, formalin fixed tissue sections. However, there is little information as to whether such assays prognosticate endocrine response.	Using antigen retrieval, the immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody ER1D5, and the streptavidin-biotin detection system, 74 patients with breast cancer in whom endocrine response was known were assayed and the results compared with ER by DCC and ER by ICA in frozen section with H222.	ER1D5 in paraffin provided the highest correlation with endocrine response (Kendall's tau [r] = 0.57; P<0.001) whereas ER by DCC failed to correlate (r= -0.002; P<0.99). ER1D5 in paraffin correlated weakly though significantly with DCC (Kappa Statistic [K] = 0.204; P<0.02). H222 in frozen sections also correlated moderately with endocrine response (r = 0.34; P<0.001).	ER can be detected in routine tissue sections processed with antigen retrieval and ER1D5, and can be relied upon to provide accurate prognostic information regarding response to endocrine therapies in breast cancer patients.	1996
8683311	Indium-111-pentetreotide uptake in endocrine tumors and lymphoma.	The biodistribution of 111In-pentetreotide was assessed in patients with gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) neuroendocrine tumors or lymphoma and in control patients and analyzed as a function of scanning time, presence or absence of tumor uptake, tumor type and previous octreotide treatment.	Patients underwent imaging 4 and 24 hr after injection of approximately 200 MBq 111In-pentetreotide. The frequency of organ visualization was assessed on planar views. Total organ and tumor uptake (% injected dose [ID]) was determined using the geometric mean method and regional tissue uptake (% ID/100 ml) by semiquantitative SPECT.	Liver, spleen, kidneys and urinary bladder were visualized in all patients. Thyroid, bowel and pituitary were more often visualized at 24 hr than at 4 hr. Activity in the gallbladder, breast, ureters and ascites was only occasionally observed. Total liver, spleen and thyroid uptake was stable over time, whereas kidney activity decreased slightly. At 24 hr, regional uptake was threefold lower in the liver than in the spleen or kidneys and was similar in the three groups. In patients with long-term octreotide therapy, a positive correlation was found between the duration of octreotide therapy and liver or spleen uptake. Total and regional tumor uptake showed high intraindividual and interindividual variations. Total tumor activity was stable over 24 hr in patients with GEP and decreased in those with lymphoma. The mean regional tumor uptake was 10-fold lower in patients with lymphoma than in those with GEP. Cold octreotide injected 24 hr after tracer administration did not result in any displacement of organ and tumor activity.	Organ uptake seems not to be influenced by the presence of 111In-pentetreotide-positive lesions or by tumor type. Tumor uptake is highly variable among patients and clearly lower in patients with lymphoma than in those with GEP. The widespread of uptake values in tumors indicates that radiotherapy using radiolabeled somatostatin analogs may not be applicable to all patients with 111In-pentetreotide-positive tumors.	1996
8737078	Cutaneous vascular control in the arms of women with postmastectomy oedema.	The control of forearm skin blood flow was examined in the swollen arms of twelve women with oedema caused by breast cancer treatment. The swollen arm was compared with the opposite unaffected (control) arm. Using laser Doppler flux (LDF) and continuous finger blood pressure (BP) measurements, vascular control was tested by applying a range of provocations previously shown to alter cutaneous vascular resistance (CVR) in healthy subjects. The tests and the accepted mechanism were: post-ischaemic hyperaemia (locally mediated vasodilatation), inspiratory gasp and cool reflex (both sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction), arm dependency (locally mediated vasoconstriction), and core heat load (sympathetically mediated vasodilatation). CVR was calculated as BP/(LDF-biological zero). Three differences between the control and swollen arms were identified. (i) The laser Doppler biological zero signal was significantly higher on the swollen side (P = 0.005, Student's paired t test). (ii) Baseline LDF was significantly lower on the swollen side (P = 0.002), and apparent CVR correspondingly higher. (iii) Cumulative reactive hyperaemia (area under the LDF curve above baseline) was significantly less on the swollen side (P = 0.03), although peak flux was not significantly different. Inspiratory gasp, cool reflex, arm dependency and core heat load produced changes of similar magnitude in both arms. It appears that sympathetic neural control and local vasoconstrictor control in arm dependency are normal in arm lymphoedema but that locally mediated vasodilator control is impaired. In addition, baseline skin blood flow may be reduced in this condition. The results provide no support for impairment of vascular tone as a contributory factor to the oedematous state.	1996
8616824	Human larynx expresses isoforms of the oestrogen receptor.	Commercially available enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were used for oestrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptor determination in the cytosol fraction of 118 human larynx cancer specimens and in the corresponding histologically proven non-malignant tissues. Fifty-one ER positive cancerous samples had corresponding non-cancerous tissues also expressing the receptor. A high resolution isoelectric focusing (IEF) technique followed by immunoblotting with the H222 anti-ER monoclonal antibody was used to evaluate the presence of ER isoforms in the 51 ER positive human larynx cancer specimens and in their corresponding non-malignant tissues. In both tissues, four ER isoforms were detected, with isoelectric points (pI) similar to those obtained in breast and endometrium carcinomas (6.1, 6.3, 6.6 and 6.8). A significant difference in the expression of ER isoforms between cancerous and non-cancerous tissue was found; precisely, the 94.1% of the ER positive non-malignant specimens co-expressed the four isoforms while they were detected in only the 35.5% of the malignant specimens (P < 0.0001 by Fisher's exact test). In larynx cancer, the concentration values of ER and PR did not correlate, nevertheless tumours co-expressing the four ER isoforms had PR levels significantly higher than those which did not (P = 0.02 by Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon sum rank test). To investigate the possibility that the isoforms of the monomeric 4S form of the ER (those with pI 6.3, 6.6, and 6.8) could dimerise, a cold agarose gel electrophoresis technique was used on IEF-separated ER isoforms. In summary, the evidence shows that all the isoforms are able to form homodimers and that the isoforms at pI 6.3 and 6.8 are able to dimerise with that at pI 6.6 but, under the same experimental conditions, they do not form the 6.3/6.8 heterodimer. It was concluded that: (1) the four isoforms of the ER are co-expressed by the non-malignant human larynx and the cancer loses the capacity to express some of them; (2) the complete complement of ER isoforms (all four) is needed for PR expression; (3) the monomeric 4S isoform with pI 6.6 has the capacity to form homo- and heterodimers, while the remaining two are only able to homodimerise.	1996
8667063	Technetium-99m-sestamibi uptake by human benign and malignant breast tumor cells: correlation with mdr gene expression.	Early diagnosis of multidrug-resistance (MDR) development is extremely important for the judicious choice of treatment protocols in breast cancer chemotherapy. In this study, the mechanism of 99mTc-sestamibi uptake by nine human breast tumor cell lines was analyzed as a function of P-glycoprotein (PgP) expression.	Technetium-99m-sestamibi radioactivity incorporation into the cells was determined after different times of incubation at 37 degrees C. We analyzed the mechanism of 99mTc-sestamibi uptake as follows: (a) effect of temperature (4 degrees C); (b) influence of extracellular 99mTc-sestamibi concentration; and (c) competitive inhibition of cell uptake with cold 99mTc-sestamibi. Technetium-99m-sestamibi uptake was compared to the level of PgP determined by Western blotting. The PgP reversing effect of verapamil was evaluated at different drug concentrations (50, 200, 500 microM).	Technetium-99m-sestamibi uptake plateaued at 60 min, which was 14 times lower at 4 degrees C than at 37 degrees C and was directly proportional to the extracellular concentration between 0.3 and 10 nM. Technetium-99m-sestamibi percentage uptake by cells expressing nonimmunodetectable levels of PgP was significantly higher (7.3% +/- 0.6% (s.d.) to 14.9% +/- 1.9%) than that by cells expressing high PgP levels (0.7% +/- 0.4%, p < 0.001). In the presence of verapamil, a known reverser of PgP functions, 99mTc-sestamibi uptake was increased by a factor of 2 in cells expressing no detectable levels of PgP and by a factor of 12 in cells with high PgP levels.	Technetium-99m-sestamibi uptake by these breast tumor cells is energy-dependent but not specific. These data suggest that 99mTc-sestamibi imaging may be used as a noninvasive technique to diagnose the presence of MDR in breast tumors in vivo.	1996
8549670	Detection of apoptosis and DNA replication by differential labeling of DNA strand breaks with fluorochromes of different color.	Selective DNA strand break induction by photolysis (SBIP) at sites that contain incorporated halogenated nucleotides has been recently proposed as a means of analyzing DNA replication and detecting proliferating cells. The presence of numerous in situ DNA strand breaks is also an inherent feature of apoptotic cells. The aim of the present study was to differentially label DNA strand breaks in apoptotic cells vs photolysis-induced breaks in BrdUrd incorporating cells. This would allow one, by multicolor staining, to identify these respective cells in the same sample preparation. Toward this end, exponentially growing HL-60 cells were pulse labeled with BrdUrd and then were subjected to hyperthermia or treated with DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin to induce apoptosis. DNA strand breaks in apoptotic cells were first labeled directly with fluorochrome-conjugated dUTP or dCTP, followed by dideoxynucleotide (to terminate chain elongation), in a reaction catalyzed by exogenous terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The cells were subsequently exposed to UV light to photolyze DNA containing the incorporated BrdUrd. The photolysis-induced DNA strand breaks were, in turn, labeled with digoxygenin- or biotin-conjugated dUTP followed by digoxygenin antibody or avidin, respectively, conjugated with fluorochrome of another color. Alternatively, DNA strand breaks were labeled with BrdUTP which was then detected by FITC-conjugated anti-BrdUrd MoAb. Following counterstaining of cellular DNA with a fluorochrome of a third color it was possible to identify apoptotic cells, cells incorporating BrdUrd, and cells having no DNA strand breaks. Cell fluorescence was measured either by flow cytometry or with the microscope-based laser scanning cytometer. The SBIP approach also offers a possibility to study a colocalization of the immunocytochemically detectable cell constituents at the DNA replication points by microscopy. Using this approach the presence of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen at the DNA replication sites was revealed in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells.	1996
7594517	CTL in mice immunized with human mucin 1 are MHC-restricted.	CTLs that recognize tumor Ags have been described in mice and humans, particularly for melanoma. These CTLs are CD8+, which is MHC-restricted. In contrast, in human carcinomas of the breast, pancreas, or ovary, and in multiple myeloma, CD8+ CTLs have been described that lyse targets expressing human MUC1 in a non-MHC-restricted manner. On the basis of these observations, we immunized mice with conjugates of mannan-human fusion protein, human mucin 1 (MUC1), which produced CD8+ CTLs. In contrast to the human anti-MUC1 CTLs found in cancer patients, the murine anti-MUC1 CTLs were clearly MHC-restricted, e.g., in inbred mice of the H-2-b, d, k, s, or z haplotypes; the H-2 restriction was also confirmed in H-2 congenic strains. Tests of H-2 recombinant strains demonstrated that MUC1 peptides were able to associate with D or K class I molecules of the b, d, or k haplotypes. Mice lacking MHC-class I molecules made weak CTL responses that were H-2Db-restricted, and in the class I H-2Kbm1 mutant strain, CTL restriction was also shown. Finally, cold target inhibition studies demonstrated that Kb and Db are recognized similarly, but Kk is less well recognized. Thus, anti-MUC1 CTLs induced by immunization of mice are different from those obtained from patients. The immunization of cancer patients with MUC1 peptides is now undergoing clinical trials and it will be of interest to observe whether the CTLs induced are HLA-restricted, not restricted, or whether both types of CTLs are produced.	1995
7594611	Tumor-specific and HLA-A2-restricted cytolysis by tumor-associated lymphocytes in human metastatic breast cancer.	A tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune response has been well documented in melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and ovarian cancer. Conflicting evidence exists regarding the existence of tumor-specific CTL populations in breast cancer. Tumor cells and tumor-associated lymphocytes (TAL) were isolated from the pleural effusions of six consecutive patients with metastatic breast cancer. After solid-phase anti-CD3 stimulation, TAL cultures were expanded with weekly autologous tumor stimulation and low-dose IL-2 for 3 wk. T cell populations were characterized using flow cytometric analysis and ranged from 49 to 91% CD8+, > 98% CD3+, and < 3% CD16+. Functionally, tumor-stimulated TAL showed tumor-specific recognition of autologous tumor cells (241 +/- 142 LU20/10(7)) and no detectable lysis of autologous fibroblasts, Daudi or K562. Cytotoxicity of TAL against HLA-A2+ allogeneic targets was significantly higher when compared with HLA-A2- tumor cell lines (127 +/- 76 vs 6 +/- 18 LU, p = 0.0001). This cytotoxicity against autologous and allogeneic tumor cells was blocked by anti-HLA-A2 mAb and cold HLA-A2+ targets in cold-target inhibition assays. TAL from all HLA-A2+ patients recognized GP2, a known, HER2/neu-derived tumor-associated peptide Ag that is HLA-A2 restricted. We have shown that TAL obtained from metastatic effusions of breast cancer patients contain lymphocytes that can recognize and lyse autologous and allogeneic tumor cells in a tumor-specific, HLA-A2-restricted fashion. In addition, tumor-specific TAL derived from breast cancer patients can selectively lyse HLA-A2+ pancreatic and ovarian tumor cell targets, suggesting a common HLA-A2-restricted tumor-associated Ag between these distinct epithelial cancers. Further elucidation of the cell-mediated immune response to breast cancer and the identification of shared TAA could result in the development of broadly applicable vaccine therapies for many cancers.	1995
7495699	Immunocytochemical detection of androgen receptor in human temporal cortex characterization and application of polyclonal androgen receptor antibodies in frozen and paraffin-embedded tissues.	Immunocytochemical and biochemical studies have demonstrated the presence of androgen receptor protein in various regions of the rodent and non-human primate cortex. Localization of androgen receptor in the human brain has, however, not been studied as extensively, because of difficulties in obtaining suitable tissue samples. In the present study, we have localized androgen receptors in both frozen and paraffin-embedded temporal cortex from epileptic patients undergoing resection. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against fusion proteins containing fragments of the human androgen receptor protein. The antibodies were affinity-purified against the corresponding fusion protein. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting using extracts from human cell lines demonstrated the specificity of the antibodies for the human androgen receptor and lack of cross-reactivity with other steroid hormone receptors. Immunocytochemistry was performed on frozen and paraffin sections of human temporal cortex and in paraffin-embedded benign hyperplastic prostates (BPH), as well as prostate and breast carcinomas, by the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase method. Antigen-retrieval was performed in paraffin-embedded sections using microwave irradiation. Specific nuclear and cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for androgen receptor was detected in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia cells of the temporal cortex. In contrast, only nuclear staining was observed in BPH, prostate and breast carcinomas. Immunoprecipitation of human temporal cortex lysate and subsequent Western blot analysis demonstrated the expression of a 98 kDa immunoreactive protein, slightly smaller than the reported molecular weight of the wild-type androgen receptor. These results provide further evidence for the expression of androgen receptor in the human temporal cortex. The use of these immunocytochemical techniques should enable the retrospective determination of possible changes in androgen receptor expression in a variety of archival paraffin-embedded tissues, including samples of the human central nervous system.	1995
7667636	CDC25 phosphatases as potential human oncogenes.	Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) are activated by CDC25 phosphatases, which remove inhibitory phosphate from tyrosine and threonine residues. In human cells, CDC25 proteins are encoded by a multigene family, consisting of CDC25A, CDC25B, and CDC25C. In rodent cells, human CDC25A or CDC25B but not CDC25C phosphatases cooperate with either Ha-RASG12V or loss of RB1 in oncogenic focus formation. Such transformants were highly aneuploid, grew in soft agar, and formed high-grade tumors in nude mice. Overexpression of CDC25B was detected in 32 percent of human primary breast cancers tested. The CDC25 phosphatases may contribute to the development of human cancer.	1995
7657935	Effect of season and climate on choice of therapy for breast cancer in older women.	We and others have previously found a relative underutilization of breast-conserving surgery with adjuvant radiation therapy in older women diagnosed with early stage breast cancer. Because adjuvant radiotherapy involves daily trips to a facility for 6 weeks, we reasoned that season and climate might influence choice of therapy. Specifically we hypothesized that in northern states, a lower proportion of women would receive breast-conserving surgery plus radiation in the winter months than in summer, whereas in sunbelt states there would be no relationship between season and therapy.	Analysis of national Medicare billing tapes for 1990 and SEER tumor registry data for 1983-1990.	43,083 women aged 65 to 79, diagnosed with local or regional breast cancer in 50 states or Washington, DC, who underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery in 1990, and 32,502 women aged 65 to 79 who underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery from 1983 to 1989 at any of the nine SEER sites.	Using a variety of analytical approaches, we could find no consistent effect of cold winter climate on choice of breast cancer therapy.	Bad weather does not appear to discourage the choice of breast-conserving treatment. It is not known if bad weather influences actual receipt of radiotherapy.	1995
7620489	Effect of major dietary modifications on immune system in patients with breast cancer: a pilot study.	A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effect of diet on immune function in nine premenopausal, post-therapy patients with breast cancer. The patients were instructed on following the American Cancer Society dietary guidelines and were told to do so from day 0 to day 28. These guidelines recommend a high-fiber, low-fat diet. On day 29, the patients continued the diet but included fish high in omega-3 fatty acids until day 56. Twenty-four-hour urine and blood samples, and 3-day diet records were obtained on days 0, 28, and 56. The following parameters were monitored: lymphocyte subsets, T-cell function (proliferation and cytolytic response), and urinary prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Results throughout the study suggested a benefit from decreasing dietary fat intake, and increasing fish intake. Helper T-cell (CD4) percentage increased from day 0 to days 28 and 56 (P = 0.048). Cytotoxic/suppressor T-cell (CD8) percentage decreased from day 0 to days 28 and 56 (P = 0.002). The CD4/CD8 cell ratio increased by days 28 and 56 (P = 0.0004). The proliferation of CD4 cells increased from day 0 to days 28 and 56 (P = 0.005). Significant changes were not found in the cytolytic activity of T cells, natural killer cells, total T and B cells, or urinary prostaglandin E2. Results suggest that patients with breast cancer may benefit from following American Cancer Society dietary guidelines and consuming cold-water ocean fish.
7554656	Investigation of abnormal appearing thyroid glands on Tc-99m sestamibi breast scintimammography.	Of 507 breast scintimammograms performed using Tc-99m sestamibi, 34 patients were incidentally found to have abnormal appearing thyroid glands. The authors sought to investigate the clinical significance and/or ascertain an extraneous causative factor for these findings. One cold thyroid nodule was detected and was proven benign through biopsy. Two cases of subacute and chronic thyroiditis were proven, and it is possible that additional patients had this disease process. Focal areas of increased thyroid Tc-99m sestamibi uptake were observed in eight patients and probably represent parathyroid adenomas, nonautonomous hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules, or nontoxic multinodular goiter. The results did not yield an extraneous causative factor, underlying pathology, or clinically significant disease in all of the patients investigated, but the findings suggest a need for careful evaluation of any unusual uptake in the thyroid gland and the rest of the image. The authors do not recommend investigation of all abnormal appearing thyroid glands on Tc-99m sestamibi scintimammography. However, clinical correlation should be recommended.	1995
7645919	Immunohistochemical detection of P-glycoprotein on frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue sections of normal and malignant tissues.	In this study the reactivity of the monoclonal antibodies (mabs) C 219, C 494 and 4E3 was compared on frozen and paraffin-embedded normal tissues and tumors. On frozen tissues we used an indirect immunoperoxidase method, while on paraffin sections a streptavidin-biotin method without antigen retrieval methods was used. In normal tissues all mabs were reactive with colon epithelium in frozen and paraffin-embedded sections. The bile canaliculi in the liver showed the most extensive reaction with C 219 in frozen sections, and to a lesser extent with C 494 and 4E3. C 219 reacted with the pancreatic acinar and ductal epithelium, whereas C 494 and 4E3 reacted predominantly in the stroma. The kidney showed positivity for all mabs in the collecting ducts and isolated solitary cells were reactive in the spleen. In the skin the eccrine part of the sweat glands was reactive for all mabs in paraffin sections. The lung, prostate and breast were negative for all mabs. Only in paraffin sections of various tissues did the C 494 appear to be reactive with nerve fibers and ganglion cells. Colon cancers were positive for P-170 with all mabs tested. In breast carcinoma C 494 showed positive reactions in 8/26 frozen and 4/22 paraffin sections, while 4E3 was reactive with 20/25 frozen but only with 1/21 paraffin sections. C 219 gave similar results in frozen (22/26) and paraffin (17/26) sections of breast cancer. Ovarian carcinomas were positive with C 494 in 11/20 of the frozen and in 11/15 of the paraffin sections, while 4E3 again reacted more weakly in paraffin (5/15) than in frozen (15/20) sections. C 219 gave positive reactions in all ovarian carcinomas in frozen (20/20) and paraffin sections (14/14). In the tumors, the most intense reaction for all mabs was obtained in the colon, followed by the ovary and breast. Enhanced staining was seen in paraffin sections for mab C 494 in ovarian carcinoma. By demonstrating the presence of both an external and internal epitope on frozen sections, the combined use of 4E3 and C 219 gave complementary information about the expression of P-170.

7776978	Regulation by estrogen through the 5'-flanking region of the mouse calbindin-D28k gene.	Mouse calbindin-D28k expression is regulated in vivo by estradiol in ovaries, uterus, and oviduct. To determine whether estrogen can have an effect on the transcription of the calbindin-D28k gene, the human breast cancer cells T47D were transiently transfected with a plasmid containing a 1.1 kilobase (kb) PstI/SacII fragment (-1075/+34) of the mouse calbindin gene ligated to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and cotransfected with human estrogen receptor expression vector. T47D cells, transfected and treated with estradiol (10(-11) - 10(-7) M for 64-65 h), exhibited a dose-dependent increase in CAT activity (up to 6.2-fold). Transfection of MCF-7 breast cancer cells with the chimeric gene construct alone also resulted in an estradiol-dependent induction in CAT activity. Deletion mutant analysis demonstrated that there are two regions of the mouse calbindin-D28k promoter (between -1075/-702 and between -175/-78) that contribute to the induction by estradiol. These fragments, when linked to the thymidine kinase promoter to construct a heterologous promoter chimera, were able to convert the thymidine kinase promoter to estrogen responsiveness. In these regions there are multiple imperfect half-palindromic estrogen-responsive elements. Gel retardation assays demonstrated weak protein-DNA interactions that were competed with cold oligonucleotide containing the vitellogenin estrogen-response element. These findings indicate that the mouse calbindin-D28k promoter is capable of conferring estrogen responsiveness, which may be mediated by several imperfect half-palindromic estrogen-responsive elements, and suggest, in light of previous studies concerning 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D regulation, multiple steroid regulation of the calbindin-D28k gene.	1995
7773157	A simplified method for cryopreservation of hematopoietic stem cells with -80 degrees C mechanical freezer with dimethyl sulfoxide as the sole cryoprotectant.	A simplified method for cryopreservation was developed with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) as the sole cryoprotectant without rate-controlled freezing. This method produced high recovery rate for mononucleated cells (87%) and elevated trypan blue viability (90%). Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) and bone marrow cells with plasma and 10% DMSO were frozen and stored in a -80 degrees C mechanical freezer. Eleven patients with solid and hematological malignancies were transplanted with autologous bone marrow or PBSCs. The median number of infused mononuclear cells (MNC) and CD34+ cells were 3.63 x 10(8)/Kg and 4.80 x 10(6)/Kg, respectively. The median number of infused post-thawing CFU-GM was 20 x 10(4)/Kg. All patients showed a rapid and sustained engraftment. The mean times to reach a neutrophil count of 0.5 x 10(9)/L and a platelet count of 50 x 10(9)/L were 11 and 13 days, respectively. All patients are alive and 10 in unmaintained complete remission for 3-9 months after transplantation. These results show the efficacy of this simplified cryopreservation technique that will be useful for institutions without rate-controlled freezing facilities.	1995
7773148	P-glycoprotein expression in acute myeloblastic leukemia analyzed by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry.	Using the APAAP technique, we assessed the reactivity of five monoclonal antibodies, JSB1, C219, Mab 57, 2F8 and MRK16, to gp 170 in 60 cases of de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 13 relapses. Reactivity, varied between the five antibodies, and positivity was obtained with 2F8 > JSB1 > MRK16 > Mab57 > C219. Sixteen of the 60 cases were also studied by flow cytometry. In 10 cases, the results with the two techniques corresponded, in the other 6 cases, flow cytometry proved more sensitive than APAAP in detecting small amounts of gp170. In the flow cytometry analysis, the cells fixed in methanol and paraformaldehyde were more fluorescent than unfixed samples or those fixed in paraformaldehyde or methanol alone. Our results thus reveal that positivity for gp 170 depends on various factors, including the specificity of the monoclonal antibodies, the techniques used and the preservation of the samples. This suggests the need for a clear standardization of the methods to detect gp170.	1995
7777482	Nuclear morphometry in breast cancer: the influence of sampling rules and freezing of samples.	We studied nuclear morphometry of human breast cancer with special emphasis on two sources of variation: freezing prior to fixation and selection of measured objects on the basis of different sampling rules. Samples of 147 histologically verified invasive breast cancer cases were examined with a computer-based image overlay drawing system. Thirty-eight of the 147 samples of tissue frozen before embedding in paraffin were analyzed separately. Among the latter we found shrinkage of 35% and 46% (depending on the sampling rule) of the nuclear profile area as compared with samples not frozen before the standard tissue processing. These findings confirm that nuclear morphometry results from frozen and unfrozen tissue are not comparable. Frozen tissue later embedded in paraffin should not be used with prognostication models based on traditionally fixed tissue. In morphometry we applied two sampling rules that differed in the criteria used for selecting nuclei for measurement. We registered a significant difference in nuclear size and in the variation of nuclear size between the two sampling methods. Of the morphometric features studied, nuclear area was affected most. Finally, we examined the two sampling rules in light of the established prognosticators in breast cancer: tumor size, axillary lymph node status, and the Multivariate Prognostic Index (MPI). The two sampling rules resulted in different distributions of morphometric results in the prognostic groups. Our findings emphasize the significance of the sources of variation in nuclear morphometry. They also stress the need for well-standardized morphometric methods in predicting the outcome of breast cancer.	1995
7816807	Comparative genomic analysis of tumors: detection of DNA losses and amplification.	We demonstrate the use of representational difference analysis for cloning probes that detect DNA loss and amplification in tumors. Using DNA isolated from human tumor cell lines to drive hybridization against matched normal DNA, we were able to identify six genomic regions that are homozygously deleted in cultured cancer cells. When this method was applied in the reverse way, using normal DNA to drive hybridization against tumor cell DNA, we readily isolated probes detecting amplification. Representational difference analysis was also performed on DNAs derived from tumor biopsies, and we thereby discovered a probe detecting very frequent homozygous loss in colon cancer cell lines and located on chromosome 3p.	1995
7695887	Immunohistochemical study of estrogen receptors in primary breast carcinomas and their lymph node metastases including comparison of two monoclonal antibodies.	Estrogen receptors (ER) status was investigated in 101 primary breast carcinomas and their axillary lymph node metastases to determine if the malignant cells retained or changed this phenotypic feature during the metastatic process. Immunohistochemistry with the ER-ICA kit (Abbott Laboratory) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue was used (paraffin ER-ICA). The ER status in primary and secondary tumours was concordant in 80 patients (79%) and discordant in 21 (21%). Eighteen of these twenty-one patients had ER-positive primary tumours and ER-negative lymph node metastases. This discordance, which may be due to loss of ERs in the metastatic cells or tumour heterogeneity, could explain the well-known failure of endocrine treatment in some of the patients with ER-positive primary tumours. A new monoclonal antibody ID5 (DAKO) against ERs was applied on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue from 83 of these 101 primary carcinomas. These analyses and paraffin ER-ICA analyses were compared to prior analyses of the same 83 tumours using the ER-ICA kit on fresh frozen tissue ("gold standard", frozen ER-ICA). Kappa coefficient, sensitivity and specificity were 0.74, 0.96 and 0.75 for ID5 antibody, and 0.59, 0.72 and 0.96 for ER-ICA antibody on paraffin sections.	1995
7825256	[Chemotherapy in metastasing breast cancer--is it beneficial?].	Carcinoma of the breast is the most common type of cancer among women in Denmark (3,000 new cases a year). About half of the patients will at some time develop metastases. Treatment of extended disease is controversial. Public discussion has focused on whether it is desirable to treat these patients with chemotherapy or not. This case story describes four cases with long term survival (nine, ten, 14, 19 years after début of metastases). This underlines that it is possible within the existing types of treatment to achieve both extended survival and acceptable life quality. The doctor's dilemma is that he does not know whom treatment helps. We conclude that treatment should be offered to all patients. This will be of benefit to the whole group.	1994
7825248	[The significance of chemotherapy for survival after recurrent breast cancer. A population based study of patients treated in the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's].	In a population-based study survival after recurrence was compared in three cohorts of patients each with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer in either 1959, 1969 end 1979. The use of chemotherapy after recurrence in these cohorts was either none, sporadic or widespread. This allowed a retrospective analysis of the survival impact of chemotherapy. Our data suggest that chemotherapy in recurrent breast cancer prolongs survival by 9.5 months in patients who survive more than two weeks from the start of treatment for their recurrence, given the basic assumption that the natural history of breast cancer and the influence of endocrine therapy have not changed significantly during the 20-year period covered by the study.	1994
7893481	Assay of estrogen and progesterone receptors in small samples of breast cancer: II. The conventional procedure compared to the mathematical one.	Parallel assays of ER and PR receptors have been performed in the same tissue samples using both the conventional method employing two sets of test tubes and a mathematical method which does not need the second set of tubes containing excess cold ligand concentrations. Determinations have been performed in calf uterus and human breast cancer samples. Findings show that the two methods give quite similar results. In particular, they are very close in human BC tissues where receptor density values show a very wide range. The mathematical method seems quite useful when the samples are poor of receptors, a case where the precision of the method may influence both prognosis and therapy.
8027372	Erythrocyte autoantibodies, autoimmune haemolysis, and carcinoma.	To examine a large series of patients in whom both red cell autoantibodies and carcinoma are present; and to determine whether this rare occurrence is a true association or a chance event.	The laboratory records of 160 patients (76 men, 84 women; mean age 68 years) with erythrocyte autoantibodies and confirmed carcinoma were examined for site of tumour origin and clinical and immunohematological findings. To test whether the concomitant occurrence of autoantibodies and carcinoma was fortuitous, data on total population and carcinoma incidence were included in a chi 2 analysis.	The association was significant (chi 2 = 97.5, p < 0.0005); erythrocyte autoantibodies and carcinoma were found together 12-13 times more often than expected from their relative frequencies. Autoantibodies occurred with a variety of carcinomas, particularly those of breast, lung, colon, rectum, and prostate; this largely reflected tumour incidence. Adenocarcinoma, squamous, anaplastic, and transitional cell types were all represented. Warm, cold, and mixed autoantibodies were not associated with particular tumour sites or histology. Eighty six patients had haemolysis of varying severity, 37 had metastatic disease, and 28 died within a few months of presentation.	The presence of erythrocyte autoantibodies and carcinoma in the same patient is a true association and probably reflects a fundamental disturbance in immune homeostasis. It tends to occur with a large tumour mass and metastatic disease, and generally indicates a poor prognosis.	1994
8004992	Patterns of ice formation in normal and malignant breast tissue.	Normal and malignant human breast tissues were obtained from resection surgery and frozen on a directional solidification stage with controlled and uniform cooling rates. The frozen samples were freeze substituted and examined with a light microscope. It was observed that in both normal and malignant tissue, ice forms first in the connective tissue. The ice propagates along the connective tissue, which surrounds fat cells in normal adipose tissue and clumps of tightly packed malignant cells in the diseased tissue. This mode of freezing affects the osmotic response of malignant cells, causing intracellular ice crystal formation at unusually low cooling rates.	1994
7515672	Influence of fixation and preparation on the AgNOR distribution in routinely processed breast cancer specimens.	AgNOR staining is mostly performed on unstained sections from paraffin-embedded material. This well-established application may be limited, if only a small biopsy or cytologic material is available. In this study, we analyzed the influence of different routine preparation types from histology and cytology on AgNOR staining results. 15 cases of ductal breast carcinoma were investigated using five different preparations per case: frozen sections, sections from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, previously frozen material, sections from routinely formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded fresh material, alcohol-fixed and air-dried cytological smears. After application of a modified combined Feulgen-AgNOR staining technique, AgNOR quantification on 150 nuclei per specimen was performed by TV-image analysis. For each preparation type adequate AgNOR staining results were obtained. Although there were a number of statistically significant correlations, the median values for the mean nuclear area, the mean number of AgNORs per cell, the mean AgNOR area per cell and the mean AgNOR sum area per cell were quite different within the 5 preparation types. This means that results, obtained with one preparation type, may not be taken as standard for a different one.	1994
8275464	Evidence for the existence of a third progesterone receptor protein in human breast cancer cell line T47D.	We have used a new monoclonal antibody, designated C-262, directed against the last 14 amino acids of the carboxy-terminus of human progesterone receptors (N.L. Weigel et al., Mol. Endocrinol., 6: 1585-1597, 1992) to analyze progesterone receptor structure. This new antibody recognizes the previously described B-receptors (M(r) 120,000) and the naturally occurring N-terminal truncated A-receptor (M(r) 94,000). In addition to B- and A-receptors, C-262 detects a third progestin-binding protein with a molecular weight of approximately 60,000 in the progestin-responsive human breast cancer cell line, T47D. The 60,000 dalton protein is predominantly found in the cytosolic fraction of untreated T47D cells and binds tightly to the nucleus following progesterone or R5020 treatment of T47D cells. These dynamics are similar to the previously described progesterone receptor isoforms. The 60,000 dalton protein binds the synthetic progestin, [3H]R5020, which competes with cold R5020 as determined with the technique of in situ photoaffinity labeling. Prolonged incubation of nuclear extracts at elevated temperatures does not result in accumulation of the 60,000 dalton protein, yet the level of photoaffinity-labeled B- and A-receptors declines. These data support our hypothesis that the 60,000 dalton protein is not a degradation product of the two larger progesterone receptor isoforms but a distinct progestin-binding protein. This is further supported by our previous study identifying at least two progesterone receptor mRNAs that do not code B- or A-receptors. These two transcripts are not unique to T47D cells and also are present in human breast cancer cells, MCF-7, and normal human endometrium. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the existence of a third progesterone receptor isoform in progestin-responsive tissues.	1994
7865431	Taxol (paclitaxel): mechanisms of action.	Paclitaxel, an antitumor drug that is demonstrating encouraging activity in human malignancies, is likely to play a major role in cancer chemotherapy. Paclitaxel has an unusual chemical structure--it is a complex diterpene having a taxane ring with a four-membered oxetane ring and an ester side chain at position C-13--and a unique mechanism of action. In vitro, paclitaxel enhances the polymerization of tubulin to stable microtubules and also interacts directly with microtubules, stabilizing them against depolymerization by cold and calcium, which readily depolymerize normal microtubules. The fact that the drug has a specific binding site on the microtubule polymer makes it unique among chemotherapeutic agents, and the ability of paclitaxel to polymerize tubulin in the absence of cofactors like guanosine triphosphate and microtubule-associated proteins is unusual. When paclitaxel and microtubule protein are irradiated with ultraviolet light, the drug preferentially binds covalently to the beta-subunit of tubulin. Paclitaxel binds to cells in a specific and saturable manner with a single set of high-affinity binding sites. The microtubule cytoskeleton is reorganized in the presence of paclitaxel and extensive parallel arrays or stable bundles of microtubules are formed in cells growing in tissue culture. Paclitaxel blocks cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle and such cells are unable to form a normal mitotic apparatus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1994
7823585	Estrogen receptor immunocytochemistry: the promise and the perils.	Estrogen receptor immunocytochemistry (ERICA) is favored over dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) or sucrose gradient assay (SGA) by many pathologists and oncologists since it allows an estimation of tumor cell and tissue heterogeneity and permits assays to be performed on specimens not suitable for DCC/SGA. Additionally, ERICA can be performed with greater ease and with less expense at the level of the community hospital pathology laboratory. Initially, like DCC/SGA, ERICA had to be done on fresh or frozen tumor samples or face a significant loss in sensitivity when applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections. Recently, several anti-estrogen receptor (ER) antibodies have appeared which can be successfully employed to assay routinely prepared tissue sections if used in conjunction with new antigen-retrieval techniques such as the microwave oven and citrate buffers. However, more work is needed to correlate results of these new procedures with biochemical ER assays, endocrine response, and survival before they can be reliably employed as prognostic parameters. Furthermore, if any ER assay is to be useful and valid, strict attention must be paid to details of specimen collection, freezing, and fixation in order to inhibit receptor degradation and false negative results.	1994
7823584	Immunohistochemical detection of sex steroid receptors in breast cancer using routine paraffin sections: comparison with frozen sections and enzyme immunoassay.	Estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER and PR) on 48 surgically removed breast cancers were evaluated by three methods: immunoenzymatic (ER/PR-EIA), immunohistochemical in frozen sections (ER/PR-ICA), and immunohistochemical in paraffin sections (ER/PR-PAR). The monoclonal antibodies H222 and KD68 were used for immunohistochemical detection of ER and PR, respectively. Immunohistochemical stains for pS2, an estrogen-regulated protein, were also done for compatibility with previous ER/PR-PAR studies. We assessed concordance with chi-square and Pearson's correlation coefficient. We concluded that ER/PR-PAR is the least sensitive of the three assays (90.9% ER, 88.5% PR) and, until appropriate technical and clinical validation is achieved, should not be used as a first-line assay. Also, because of this lower sensitivity, we recommended that pS2 evaluation always accompany ER/PR-PAR to facilitate distinction between clinical negatives and those due to irretrievably lost immunoreactivity. We also conclude that ER/PR-ICA is a good semi-quantitative method that, in combination with ER/PR-EIA, most accurately assesses receptor status.	1994
7587125	Molecular cytogenetics of human breast cancer.	Our studies of human breast cancer using CGH and FISH with precisely mapped probes have revealed a surprising amount of intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity in human breast cancers. However, some regions of abnormal copy number are found frequently. We believe that the regions of frequent abnormality harbor novel cancer genes, and that identification of these is important for diagnosis, prognostication, and the development of new therapies.	1994

7587109	Progress toward isolation of a breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA1.	The high incidence of breast cancer and/or ovarian cancer in some families appears to be due to germ-line mutations in BRCA1. Genetic analysis of such families suggests that the BRCA1 candidate region lies between D17S857 and D17S78 on chromosome 17q21 (Kelsell et al. 1993; Simard et al. 1993). To identify and isolate BRCA1, we have used linkage and meiotic recombination analysis, characterized regions displaying LOH in tumor DNA from BRCA1-linked families, performed YAC and cosmid clone isolation and ordering, and used three complementary transcript-searching strategies. We have identified as many as 28 genes from the BRCA1 candidate region, and we are searching for constitutive mutations in these candidate genes by several methods in an attempt to identify BRCA1.	1994

7506924	Problems with p53 immunohistochemical staining: the effect of fixation and variation in the methods of evaluation.	The availability of antibodies which recognise p53 protein in paraffin-embedded tissue has created the opportunity to use immunohistochemistry to study the expression of p53 in a wide variety of clinical material. In this paper we have investigated the relationship between the type of fixative and the pattern of p53 staining in mammary carcinoma. Optimal results were obtained from breast tissue fixed in phenol formol saline, methacarn or cold formol saline with positive staining for stabilised p53 protein occurring in 69/95 (73%) cases studied. Care must be taken in the interpretation of these results since positive staining for p53 protein is not always indicative of mutation of the p53 gene. Furthermore, a range of staining patterns is seen in mammary carcinomas, making interpretation difficult. Assessment of staining needs to be standardised in order that different studies can be compared. However, in breast carcinoma, p53 immunohistochemistry appears to give information relating to tumour grade and, independently, to prognosis.	1994
7512643	Beta 1 and beta 4 integrin expression in methacarn and formalin-fixed material from in situ ductal carcinoma of the breast.	The integrins are alpha beta heterodimeric transmembrane proteins mediating cell-substratum as well as cell-cell interactions. Previous distribution studies on integrin expression have been limited by the requirement of cryostat sectioned tissues, and consequent poor resolution. We have examined 40 examples of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) for the expression of both beta 1 and beta 4 integrin chains. These showed strong polarized membrane staining of residual myoepithelial cells (correlating with expression of smooth muscle specific actin) and of the basement membrane region with beta 1 and beta 4 antibodies respectively. In 12 out of 40 cases, the DCIS was negative for the beta 1 chain and a variable pattern of reactivity was seen in the remaining cases. The beta 4 chain was detected focally and weakly in the tumour cells of 7/40 DCIS and strongly in one; all of these cases were also positive for the beta 1 chain. Of the 22 cases where co-existent invasion was present, the infiltrating component showed either a similar degree or a diminution of the extent of immunostaining when compared with the in situ component; only one showed enhanced staining (beta 1 only). This study demonstrates that two of the main beta chains, beta 1 and beta 4, can be effectively demonstrated on methacarn and cold (4 degrees C) formalin-fixed tissues by avidin-biotin indirect immunoperoxidase staining and that the results are similar to those achieved using frozen tissue.	1993
7692024	Estrogen receptor analysis of human temporomandibular disc.	Epidemiological studies of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction suggest a significant female predilection for symptomatic disease. Because previous primate research revealed sexual dimorphism in the estrogen receptors (ER) present in the masticatory apparatus, this investigation was undertaken to assess the presence of ER in human TMJ tissues. The negative findings suggest that ER status does not contribute to symptomatic TMJ disease.	1993
8353045	Scintigraphic evaluation of functional hepatic mass in patients with advanced breast cancer.	Recent studies suggest a high specificity of 99mTc-galactosyl neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA) receptor scanning in vivo by providing both morphological and functional diagnosis of liver disease. In 22 patients with advanced breast cancer 99mTc-NGA (150 MBq; 50 nmol) was exclusively trapped by the liver, the images showing 'cold spots' in areas of liver metastases formation. A two-tailed analysis was performed: the time activity curves recorded for the liver and precordial area were subjected to a kinetic receptor-calculating model allowing an estimation of the NGA-receptor concentration of the liver (i.e. hepatic binding protein, HBP) as well as calculation of the residual functional liver volume (RFLV) via the S.P.E.C.T.-study. In breast cancer patients with liver metastases a significantly (P < 0.01) lower HBP-concentration was estimated (0.65 +/- 0.16 vs 0.82 +/- 0.17 mumol l-1) as evidenced by a lower 99mTc-NGA-accumulation in the liver resulting also in a significantly (P < 0.001) lower RFLV (739 +/- 348 vs 1336 +/- 184 ml). In four amonafide-treated patients (800 mg m-2 intravenous infusion over 3 h) approximately one week after one chemotherapy cycle a significant (P < 0.05) increase in HBP-concentration (0.56 +/- 0.10 vs 0.72 +/- 0.06 mumol l-1) of the liver was found corresponding with an increase in RVLF (546 +/- 297 vs 670 +/- 265 ml). These regulatory mechanisms at the HBP level measured in vivo provide further evidence that 99mTc-NGA should have promise as a clinically useful receptor radiopharmaceutical for both quantification of liver function and assessment of liver morphology.	1993
8312581	The luteal heat cycle of the breast in health.	Wearing a special thermometric brassiere, twenty-five normal women self-measured their breast surface temperature. The subjects averaged 39 years of age and all were parous. Observations were made for one hour each evening for one menstrual cycle under semi-standardized domestic conditions. They also collected daily samples of saliva for radioimmunoassay of progesterone concentration. The surface temperature of the breast is relatively cold around mid-cycle; thereafter, and without interruption in averaged data, the temperature increases steadily by about 1 degree C over the 12 days of the luteal phase; around the time of the menses, it falls rapidly. This heat rhythm does not occur in peri-menopausal low progesterone menstrual cycles or in patients where the breast tissue has been irradiated for cancer treatment.	1993
8274552	A comparison between scalpel and electrocautery in modified radical mastectomy.	To compare the effects of a conventional cold scalpel and electrocautery in modified radical mastectomy.	A non-randomised controlled trial.	Teaching hospital in Southern Taiwan.	101 consecutive patients with primary breast cancer who underwent modified radical mastectomy between July 1987 and June 1989.	The 44 patients during the first year were allocated to have skin flaps fashioned conventionally with a cold scalpel and the 57 patients during the second year, by electrocautery.	Morbidity and mortality among the 101 patients who underwent modified radical mastectomy.	The groups were comparable in regard to age, menopause, cancer stage, weight of specimen and histological type of cancer. The mean blood loss was 567 ml when scalpel was used and 150 ml when electrocautery was used (p < 0.001). The postoperative fall in packed cell volume was significantly greater in the scalpel group (0.75 [0.26] compared with 0.28 [0.15], p < 0.001) and more patients in this group required transfusion (9 compared with 0, p < 0.01). There were no deaths in either group. There were no significant differences in operation time, total post-operative Hemovac drainage, postoperative hospital stay, the number of lymph nodes removed, the number of metastatic lymph nodes, and postoperative complications between the groups.	Electrocautery is a safe, convenient and rational method for constructing skin flaps in modified radical mastectomy, and patients do not need blood transfusions.	1993
8334108	Modulation of target-cell culture conditions alters susceptibility to lymphocyte-mediated lysis.	The culture conditions of the immortalized human breast cell line, 184B5, can be manipulated to evaluate conditions that influence target lysis by activated immune effector cells. Exponentially growing 184B5 cells (EXP) are more susceptible than growth-factor-deprived (removal of epidermal growth factor and bovine pituitary extract) 184B5 cells (GFD) to lysis by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, activated natural killer (NK) clones, and activated gamma/delta receptor expressing T-cell clones. LAK-cell lysis of contact-inhibited 184B5 cells is similar to lysis of GFD, while 184B5 cells with severe nutrient deprivation are more easily lysed than GFD by LAK cells. In a cold target inhibition assay with LAK effector populations, EXP are better inhibitors than GFD against several targets. Further analysis of the mechanism by which changes of in vitro culture conditions alter target-cell susceptibility to immune-mediated lysis may assist therapeutic strategies that involve combinations of standard therapies with biologic approaches.	1993
8097427	Resistance of HER2/neu-overexpressing tumor targets to lymphokine-activated-killer-cell-mediated lysis: evidence for deficiency of binding and post-binding events.	HER2/neu-overexpressing tumor cell lines are relatively resistant to lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell cytotoxicity when compared to HER2/neu-nonexpressing lines. HER2/neu+ targets were also resistant to binding by LAK large granular lymphocytes (LGL) as shown by visualization at the single-cell level, a target monolayer binding assay and in "cold" target inhibition experiments. HER2/neu+ LAK-resistant ovarian cell lines demonstrated an absence of ICAM-1 expression while expression of LFA-3, N-CAM, laminin and beta 1 integrins was comparable to that of HER2/neu- targets. In contrast, the HER2/neu+ breast cell line, SKBR-3, which was also resistant to lysis and binding by LAK LGL, demonstrated normal expression of ICAM-1. Anti-ICAM-1 antibodies blocked binding and lysis of HER2/neu- carcinoma targets by LAK cells, further supporting the notion that lack of ICAM-1 expression on HER2/neu+ cells contributes to their resistance. The modest binding and lysis of HER2/neu+ targets by LAK cells was significantly inhibited by anti-LFA-1 antibodies, suggesting the existence of another counter-receptor for LFA-1 on HER2/neu+ targets. The following also supported deficiencies in post-binding events when HER2/neu+ cells resisted the lytic activity of LAK cells: (a) when the relative resistance to effector cell binding was overcome by exogenous lectin. HER2/neu+ cell lines were still resistant to LAK cytolysis, and (b) HER2/neu+ targets were resistant to perforin-containing granule extracts obtained from the CTLL-R8 cytotoxic lymphocyte cell line. These results indicate that deficiency in effector binding as well as post-binding events contributes to the resistance of HER2/neu-overexpressing tumor targets to LAK-cell-mediated lysis.	1993
8518025	The influence of chemotherapy on survival after recurrence in breast cancer--a population-based study of patients treated in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.	In a population-based study survival after recurrence was compared in three cohorts of patients with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer in 1959, 1969 and 1979, respectively. The use of chemotherapy after recurrence in these cohorts was either none, sporadic or widespread. This allowed a retrospective analysis of the survival impact of chemotherapy. Given the basic assumption that the natural history of breast cancer and the influence of endocrine therapy have not changed significantly during the 20-year period covered by the study, our data suggest that chemotherapy in recurrent breast cancer prolongs survival by 9.5 months in patients who survive more than 2 weeks from the start of treatment for this recurrence.	1993
8305224	Image subtraction analysis with technetium-99M labeled monoclonal antibody and colloid for evaluation of liver lesions. Phantom measurements and patient studies.	The ideal radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against cancer antigens are taken up by liver metastases; the background activity of normal liver, however, causes problems for delineation and detectability. In order to study these phenomena, a liver phantom containing hot and cold lesions of different sizes (diameters 5-32 mm) was constructed. It was placed into an elliptic cylindrical container representing a cross section of the abdomen. The specific activities in hot lesions varied from 1.85 to 14.8 MBq/ml, whereas liver phantom and cylinder activities were kept constant during different measurements. Lesions of size 1.3 cm3 could be detected without any subtractions, if the signal to background ratio was larger than 1.2. Lesions larger than 5 mm in diameter could also be detected using subtraction, which gave additional information by a factor 2-9, when the lesion sizes varied from 0.3 to 5.3 cm3 and when the specific activity in the lesions was at least twice as high as in adjacent liver. This subtraction technique was applied in 32 breast and lung cancer patients after injecting about 1,000 MBq 99mTc-labeled anti-CEA MoAb; 24 h after the antibody injection 75 MBq 99mTc-phytate was injected. The phytate + residual MoAb image was subtracted from the original antibody image. Thirteen patients had liver metastases verified by (CT, US), but only four patients had clearly observable abnormal liver uptakes in planar MoAb images. In 9 cases, additional information concerning liver metastases was obtained by subtraction technique. To judge by our phantom measurements the enhanced detectability was not an artefact.	1993

1491175	Immunological properties of a radioiodinated monoclonal antibody and its F(ab')2mu fragments directed against the polymorphic epithelial mucin of human breast cancer.	The purification of the IgM monoclonal antibody 436 against a breast tumor antigen from mouse ascitic fluid is reported. The purified immunoglobulin was radioiodinated and the resulting product assessed for its binding capacity and binding specificity. Purified IgM-436 served for F(ab')2 mu preparation which was tested for its antigen binding capacity. Radioiodinated IgM-436 and its F(ab')2 mu retained their immunological activity which was never lower than those of the corresponding cold products.
1442147	Histochemical detection of lipid peroxidation in human gastrointestinal, mammary and renal carcinomas.	Constitutional lipid peroxidation in randomly selected 32 cases of clinically advanced carcinoma from human gastrointestinal tract (20 cases), breast (8 cases) and kidney (4 cases) was examined histochemically in frozen sections using cold Schiff's reagent. Only two cases of gastrointestinal carcinoma were positive by the reagent. Non-cancerous parenchymal cells were negative. These findings suggest that detectable constitutional lipid peroxidation seldom occurs in either cancerous or normal tissues. The capacity for normal and neoplastic tissues to undergo lipid peroxidation was also studied by incubation with an iron-NADPH pro-oxidant system. Normal parenchymal cells showed, to various degrees, a positive reactivity. In gastrointestinal carcinoma, 6 out of 7 cases of well differentiated adenocarcinoma reacted positively, whereas 2 out of 8 cases of moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma disclosed weakly positive reactions. Mucinous adenocarcinomas (4 cases) were all negative. Signet-ring cell carcinoma (1 case) was positive. One out of 8 cases of breast cancer also showed positive reaction. Four renal cell carcinomas were all negative. Cancer cells have lower capacity to undergo lipid peroxidation than normal cells, when the iron-NADPH pro-oxidant system was employed. In gastrointestinal carcinoma, the ability to undergo lipid peroxidation by the iron-NADPH pro-oxidant seems to be correlated with their histological differentiation. This fact may suggest that differences in lipid composition or the NADPH enzyme system exist between well differentiated and poorly differentiated gastrointestinal malignancies.	1992
1386976	[Examination of anti-emetic effect, safety and usefulness of single oral dose of ondansetron tablet in nausea and emesis induced by anti-cancer drugs--dose-finding study of ondansetron tablet in patients receiving non-platinum anti-cancer drugs].	Inhibitory effects on acute nausea and emesis, safety and usefulness of a single oral dose of Ondansetron tablet were evaluated in 3 different dose levels for comparison by telephone registration system, in patients receiving non-platinum anti-cancer drugs. A single dose of ondansetron at 4 mg, 8 mg or 12 mg was given orally at 2 hrs before the initial administration of anti-cancer drugs. The patients were observed for 24 hours after administration of anti-cancer drugs, for occurrence of nausea and emesis. Efficacy rates of inhibitory effects on nausea and emesis were 83.3% (10/12 cases) in 4 mg dose group, 78.6% (11/14 cases) in 8 mg dose group and 84.6% (11/13 cases) in 12 mg dose group, without statistically significant difference. Side effects were observed in 3 cases (headache, cold feeling and trembling in limbs, sleepiness) in 12 mg dose group, but these symptoms were not severe and disappeared after several hours or several days. No abnormality in clinical laboratory findings attributable to Ondansetron was observed. From the above, it was considered that Ondansetron was a clinically useful anti-emetic for nausea and emesis induced by non-platinum anti-cancer drugs and that 4 mg once daily was the optimal dose.	1992
1537444	How do we classify functional status?	The original question "How do we classify functional status?" is rephrased as "How do we order or arrange the limitations of function of primary care patients in classes?". After a review of the functions to be considered, the concept of functional status is presented using empirical data from the research project "Morbidity and Functional Status of the Elderly." The group studied consisted of 5,502 patients older than age 65 and 25 general practitioners in 12 practices. Functional status was assessed using five COOP charts: physical status, psychological status, daily activities, social status, and change. Morbidity was registered using the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC). At the beginning and end of the study, 30% of the elderly patients assessed their physical functions as seriously limited, whereas 6% to 8% reported psychological problems and limitations in daily activities or social contacts. During the encounters, more serious limitations were recorded: 35% of encounters involved serious physical limitations; 18% involved serious limitations in activities of daily living, and 11% involved constant psychological problems or limitations in social contact. Women reported more physical limitations than men. Older patients reported more physical limitations than younger ones, and people living in nursing homes reported more limitations than patients living independently. From the disease-specific health profiles, we concluded that the greatest limitation of all aspects of function was scored during encounters for cerebrovascular disease, dementia, and cancer of the lung, stomach, intestine, and breast. Hypertension, "no disease," and "common cold" elicited the lowest functional limitations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1992
1378704	Polymerase chain reaction-aided analysis of gene expression in frozen tissue sections.	A simple method for the detection and localization of mRNA in single frozen breast biopsy tissue sections is described. Several extraction procedures were compared. Resuspending sections, which could be left at 0 or -70 degrees C for up to 20 min in H2O containing RNAse inhibitor, optimally released RNA with minimal DNA contamination. Reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primers yielded products visible by ethidium bromide staining (abundant sequences) or after Southern blotting (low copy message). We found that it was possible, by microdissection, to separate stromal and tumor cells and demonstrated differential expression of several genes in the two populations. With 40 cycles of amplification, dissected stromal and tumor tissue both yielded products encoding glyceraldehyde 3'-phosphate dehydrogenase but only the tumor cells gave products with primers specific for either keratin 19, heat shock protein 89 alpha or the fig oncogene, which encodes one of the fibroblast growth factor receptors that we have recently found to be expressed in breast cancers. With refinement of the dissection technique this offers a very sensitive analytical tool for measuring and defining the cellular sites of synthesis of low-abundance message, requiring only single histological sections.	1992
1622637	Cytotoxic treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Which drugs and drug combinations to use?	Although the optimal efficacy of cytotoxic therapy plateaued in the 1970s, no consensus yet exists regarding which cytotoxic combination to offer as first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer. Comparison of a combination of CAF/CEF with other cytotoxic combinations reveals that an anthracycline-containing regimen not only increases response rate, but also improves time to progression and survival. Regarding appropriate duration of cytotoxic therapy, randomized trials indicate that therapy in excess of 6 months is beneficial. Although the main objective of cytotoxic therapy in patients with metastatic disease is to palliate symptoms at the least toxic cost, the finding that adjuvant cytotoxic therapy improves survival provides a clinical and ethical rational for continued research into new drugs and combinations in the hope that new strategies can be employed not only against metastatic breast cancer but may be applied with benefit also in the adjuvant situation.	1992
1511120	Comparison of four immunochemical methods for the measurement of oestrogen receptor levels in breast cancer.	Four methods of assessing oestrogen receptor (ER) status were compared in 33 patients with operable primary breast cancer. The methods used to assess the ER status were immunocytochemical assay (ER-ICA) of frozen sections, fine needle aspirates and imprint material and enzyme immunoassay (ER-EIA) of tumour tissue. A mean overall ER positivity of 45% (15 out of 33), 41% (13 out of 32) and 21% (six out of 29) was obtained by immunocytochemical (ER-ICA) staining of frozen sections, fine needle aspirates and tumour imprints, respectively, and a mean overall ER positivity of 42% (14 out of 33) was obtained by ER-EIA. The concordance of ER positivity in pairs of data obtained from different method combinations was found to range between 72 and 91%. However, statistically there was no significant difference between the four methods on the basis of the data obtained. Good comparability has been shown between the three tissue analyses and therefore the method of choice is technically not immediately apparent.	1992
1309531	Heterogeneity of c-myc expression in histologically similar infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast.	Anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody was used to evaluate the distribution of the c-myc protein in normal and tumor cells of infiltrating ductal carcinoma. A semi-quantitative method for reporting immunohistochemical assay results (c-myc score) that enables correlations on a more quantitative basis was used in this study. HL-60 cells demonstrated the strongest nuclear staining when fixed in cold acetone (4 degrees C) for 10 min. All 24 specimens of infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast and 7 of 11 samples of normal breast tissues studied revealed the presence of c-myc protein. The level of expression in normal breast tissue was much lower than that in breast cancer. Heterogeneity in expression was found within individual tumors and there were substantial differences in the level of expression among different tumors. The subcellular site of staining was predominantly nuclear, occasionally nuclear and cytoplasmic in the same cell, and rarely only cytoplasmic. All four patients with tumor cells located in close proximity to the ductal basement membrane and over-expressing c-myc protein had positive lymph nodes, suggesting that these tumors are more likely to metastasize.	1992
1934824	'Cold lesions' on bone scan. A case of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.	Photopenic osseous lesions are a well-recognized but unusual manifestation of metastatic disease on bone scintigraphy. Common primary tumors giving rise to such lesions include lung, breast, renal, and thyroid. This case report illustrates multiple "cold" osseous metastases from aggressive penile squamous cell carcinoma without radiographic destruction.	1991
1718329	Cytometrically coherent transfer of receptor proteins on microporous membranes.	A new method (Freeze-Transfer) is described for performing high-resolution immunocytochemistry for soluble cell proteins on frozen sections of biological tissues that involves thaw-mounting frozen tissue sections directly onto the surface of nitrocellulose thin films instead of directly onto glass slides. This technically straight-forward change in methodology resulted in chromogenic immunocytochemical assays for Her-2 and EGF receptors that were 1-2 orders of magnitude more sensitive while still fully utilizing the diagnostic resolving power of light microscopy. The effects of membrane pore size and surface chemistry on the resolution and intensity of Her-2 signal suggest that the enhanced sensitivity of Freeze-Transfer was caused by the cytologically coherent transfer of target molecules normally lost from cut surfaces of cells mounted on nonporous glass during assay.	1991

1709586	Cytotoxic T-lymphocytes derived from patients with breast adenocarcinoma recognize an epitope present on the protein core of a mucin molecule preferentially expressed by malignant cells.	A population of tumor-reactive cytotoxic T-cells can be propagated from tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with breast adenocarcinoma. These T-cells specifically recognize breast and pancreatic tumor cells in a major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-unrestricted fashion but not other tumors of epithelial origin or the natural killer target K562. The tumor-specific but MHC-unrestricted lytic activity of these cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) is mediated through the alpha/beta T-cell receptor. The molecule recognized by these CTLs is ductal epithelial mucin produced by breast and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. The protein core of the mucin consists of multiple tandem repeats of a 20-amino acid sequence. Antibody SM3, directed against a determinant on the mucin protein core preferentially expressed on malignant cells is able to significantly inhibit lysis of tumor cells by the CTL, while other antibodies binding to different core epitopes are not. Normal breast epithelial lines, which also express mucin but not the SM3 epitope, are not lysed by these tumor-reactive CTLs or act as cold target inhibitors of lysis of tumor lines. The data suggest that the highly repetitive nature of the mucin allows cross-linking of the T-cell receptor on mucin-specific T-cells and therefore accounts for the lack of MHC restriction seen in this system. They further suggest that the mucin core epitope recognized on tumor cells is not expressed on normal epithelial cells in a manner that can be recognized by tumor-reactive CTLs. These findings support the role of mucins as important tumor-associated antigens mediating the cellular response to certain human cancers and suggest that epithelial mucin core sequences might form the basis for an effective vaccine to augment the antitumor immune response.	1991
1657203	A convenient method for the preparation of 99mTc-labelled pentavalent DMSA and its evaluation as a tumour imaging agent.	A cold kit has been developed for the instant preparation of 99mTc-(V)-DMSA. The radiochemical purity of the radiopharmaceutical was determined by chromatography. A study of the effect of pH and stannous chloride concentrations on its labelling efficiency demonstrated that pH 8.5-9.0 and 0.2 mg stannous chloride for 1.1 mg DMSA provides the optimum formulation (98%). The addition of ascorbic acid stabilized the kit for up to 24 weeks under refrigerated temperatures. The radiopharmaceutical was found to concentrate in the bone and muscles in contrast to trivalent DMSA which accumulates in the liver and kidneys in normal mice. Studies in patients have shown its usefulness in the scintigraphy of thyroid medullary carcinoma and in the brain metastasis of breast carcinoma.
1705091	Automated immunohistochemical estrogen receptor in fixed embedded breast carcinomas.	The authors immunohistochemically assessed the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of 68 breast carcinomas by an automated method using Pronase (CalBiochem, La Jolla, CA) predigestion and alkaline phosphatase detection (Method 1). These results were compared with those obtained by an automated peroxidase-antiperoxidase method with DNAse pretreatment of fixed embedded sections (Method 2), with ER immunostain on frozen sections (Method 3), and with biochemical results (dextran-coated charcoal cytosolic [DCC] assay). Compared with the DCC assay, Methods 1, 2, and 3 gave sensitivities of 54%, 25%, and 89%, respectively. The sensitivity for Method 1 was increased to 74% in those cases with DCC results showing greater than 50 fmol/mg protein. These findings indicate that ER immunohistochemical studies on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues (as assayed by Method 1) provide useful clinical information when the results are positive. A negative result, especially if surrounding normal elements are not positive, may indicate no receptors, receptor levels less than 50 fmol/mg protein, or improper tissue preservation. In the absence of fresh tissue for ER assay by DCC assay or of frozen sections for immunostaining, and with an understanding of its limitations, this method may be useful.	1991
1997156	Purification and properties of an esterase from human breast cyst fluid.	Levels of estradiol 17 beta-ester hydrolytic activity in the breast cyst fluid (BCF) from 25 different women with fibrocystic disease of the breast were found to vary over a wide range (0-2.4 nmol/min/mg protein for estradiol acetate). On the basis of electrophoretic mobility on agarose gels, the activity from different individuals appeared to be identical. The esterase activity from a single BCF sample was purified to near homogeneity by differential ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, after the final purification step, showed two bands with molecular weights of approximately 22,000 and 23,000, neither of which was immunoreactive with a rabbit antibody raised to a crude esterase-free BCF preparation. Esterase activity could be demonstrated after extraction and renaturation of the protein eluted from the Mr 22,000 band. Resolution of the gel, however, was not good enough to rule out the presence of esterase activity in the Mr 23,000 protein. High performance liquid chromatography gel exclusion chromatography indicated a molecular weight of 90,000-95,000 for the esterase activity in crude BCF and approximately 225,000 for the purified activity, suggesting the native protein to be a tetramer which aggregated during purification. Although the natural substrate of the BCF esterase is unknown, the enzyme is able to cleave a variety of esters including acetate, valerate, and stearate esters of estradiol and p-nitrophenyl hexanoate. It is completely inhibited by diisopropylflurophosphate and diethylnitrophenyl phosphate and partially inhibited by NaF and ebelactone. The substrate and inhibitor profile of the enzyme indicates that it is a "B"-type carboxylesterase and not a protease. A comparison of the properties of the BCF esterase with those of esterases from the formed elements of the blood or from plasma suggests that the BCF esterase is not of blood origin and is probably derived from the cyst itself. Physiologically inactive lipoidal estrogens have been shown to be present in many human body fluids and tissues and it is possible that these esters serve as storage forms of the active hormone in hormonally sensitive tissues where the free steroid could be regenerated by hydrolysis.	1991
2066354	Common infections in the history of cancer patients and controls.	The association between the frequency of manifest infectious diseases and cancer risk was investigated in a case-control study at Heidelberg, FRG. A total of 255 cases with carcinomas of the stomach, colon, rectum, breast, and ovary, as well as 255 population controls and 230 hospital controls were interviewed using a standard questionnaire. Controls were matched to the cases for age, sex, and region of residence at the time of the interview. A history of common colds or gastroenteric influenza prior to the interview was found to be associated with a decreased cancer risk. Thus the odds ratios for "three or more common colds per year (on average)" versus "no common cold within the last 5 years prior to the interview" were 0.18 (95% CI = 0.05-0.69) and 0.23 (95% CI = 0.06-0.89) relative to population controls and hospital controls, respectively. There was no apparent relationship between childhood infections or other diseases reported in the earlier history, and cancer risk. While the findings are supported by previous studies and fit well into the results of other fields of cancer research, a conclusive interpretation and biological explanation cannot yet be given.	1991
2020765	Pathophysiological approaches to identifying tumor hypoxia in patients.	The present report summarizes observations of the authors on tumor oxygenation and on techniques for characterizing tumor hypoxia in patients. Cryospectrophotometric measurements of HbO2 saturations in tumor microvessels allow for estimates of the proportion of well oxygenated tissue regions. Labeling of tissue areas at oxygen (O2) tensions (pO2) less than 10 mm Hg with misonidazole may be used for a general characterization of the oxygenation status in patient tumors rather than for the determination of the radiobiologically hypoxic cell fraction. Quantitative bioluminescence and single photon imaging make it possible to determine ATP concentrations in absolute terms with a spatial resolution at the cellular level. It is shown that the ATP distribution reflects the efficiency of the O2 supply to tumors. Since all these techniques rely on biopsy material, the measured values can be assessed in relation to the histological structure and vascular pattern of the tumors. Such a direct interrelationship is not obtained when using polarographic microelectrodes in tumor tissue. However, a novel technology, the "computerized pO2 histography" has enabled direct polarographic measurements of pO2 values in patients, in extended and systematic clinical trials. Preliminary results in cervix and breast cancers demonstrate that pO2 values are lower in tumors than in adjacent normal tissues, and that great intra- and intertumoral differences occur even among tumors of the same clinical stages and histological grades, illustrating the necessity of such a pathophysiological approach to an "individualization" of tumor therapy.	1991
1659893	Sex steroid binding protein (SBP) receptors in estrogen sensitive tissues.	Since the discovery of a specific membrane binding site for sex steroid binding protein (SBP) in human decidual endometrium and in hyperplastic prostate numerous speculations have been raised on the existence of an additional non-receptor-mediated system for steroid hormone action. In the present work SBP cell membrane binding was investigated in human estrogen target tissues other than those previously studied either in the absence of steroids or in the presence of varying amounts (10(-10)-10(-6) M) of estradiol, testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, respectively. Plasma membranes obtained by differential centrifugation from homogenized samples of pre-menopausal endometrium, endometrium adenocarcinoma, normal liver and post-menopausal breast showed a specific binding of highly purified [125I]SBP: a major displacement of labeled SBP was elicited by radioinert SBP, while no significant displacement occurred when other human plasma proteins were used as cold competitors (molar excess ranging 500-10,000-fold). A specific, time-dependent binding of [125I]SBP was also observed in MCF-7 and in Hep-G2 cell lines. The different patterns of specific binding, observed in membranes from different tissues when SBP was liganded with different sex steroid molecules, leads us to consider the tissue individuality of the receptor as a further entity in the membrane recognition system for SBP.	1991
2149510	Zoladex plus tamoxifen versus Zoladex alone in pre- and peri-menopausal metastatic breast cancer.	Phase II studies examining the endocrinological and clinical efficacy of Zoladex and Zoladex plus tamoxifen have been examined in pre- and peri-menopausal women with advanced breast cancer. No adverse endocrinological interaction between the drugs have been observed. Although a higher proportion of static disease was observed with the combination of the drugs, which possibly occurred at the expense of partial remissions, the time to disease progression was extended in women who received Zoladex plus tamoxifen. Remissions were primarily restricted to patients whose tumours were ER positive. Only occasional responses were seen in ER negative disease. This was especially evident where the ER negative tumours were EGF-R positive and showed high rates of cell proliferation.	1990
2074916	Scalp cooling by cold air for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced alopecia.	A new system is described for cooling the scalp with cold air in order to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia. Compressed air was cooled by means of a vortex tube built into a hair-drier cap. This system reduced the blood flow in the scalp to 35%, the surface temperature to 14.2 degrees C and the intradermal temperature at hair follicle level to 29.2 degrees C. The low temperature could be kept constant for at least one hour of cooling. By means of comparison, with cryogel packs the lowest epidermal temperature attained was 17.9 degrees C; moreover, once this was reached after 10 min, it rapidly rose again to 20.6 degrees C after 40 min. Forty-eight patients receiving cytostatic treatment for breast cancer were subjected to scalp cooling with the cold air system, starting 15 min before chemotherapy and lasting for 90 min. With the system set at an air temperature of -12 degrees C, the treatment was well tolerated. Of the 13 patients treated with 40 mg/m2 doxorubicin in combination with other cytostatics, 6 had hair loss less than WHO grade 3, in contrast to 1 of 4 patients given cryogel packs. However, patients treated with epirubicin at 75 mg/m2 all showed grade 3 hair loss in spite of air cooling. In view of the possibility of achieving and maintaining low scalp temperatures, the cold air system is to be preferred to cryogel packs. Whether better clinical results may be obtained with cooling for longer periods and/or to lower temperatures remains to be determined.	1990
2251423	[A proposal for the treatment technique for the breast and regional lymph nodes in patients with conservatively operated neoplasms].	Adequate irradiation of regional lymph-nodes in selected patients seems to improve disease-free and over-all survival rates. Technically, regional lymph-nodes are generally treated separately (supra-infra clavicular, apex of axilla and internal mammary chain-IMC). About the treatment of the IMC nodes, there are two main problems: the identification of the individual target volume, and its correct irradiation. For the latter problem, the most employed solutions are: the inclusion of IMC in the tangential fields, the use of the direct or oblique electron beam for IMC alone. None of them is optimal regarding to the tolerance of adjacent critical organs and from a geometric and dosimetric point of view. In this paper we propose and discuss a modified method. The IMC nodes together with the breast are irradiated by a three field technique (two tangential photon beams and one oblique electron beam). Their arrangement allows to treat every part of the target by two fields, reducing the risk of hot and cold spots. This is obtained by extending the internal tangential photon beams to cover the electron beam. Wedges and different weights must be used to achieve an uniform dose distribution.	1990
2264338	[Anti-CEA immunoscintigraphy in postoperative follow-up of tumor patients. Differentiated use of various monoclonal antibody preparations].	The sensitivity of immunoscintigraphy (ISC) with monoclonal antibodies (Mab) depends on the Mab type, the radiophysical properties of the isotope, the labeling method and the tumor localization. We investigated 38 studies with three different Anti-CEA Mab (In111/I131 BW 431, n = 12; I131 IMACIS-1, n = 11; Tc99m BW 431/26, n = 15) in 35 postoperative tumor patients (31 colorectal, 1 gastric, 2 breast and 1 pancreas cancer) with a total of 62 tumor manifestations. Planar ISC was used in all studies. A dual isotope technique with Tc99m-colloid was applied for imaging of liver metastases in the In111/I131 BW 431/31 and I131 IMACIS-1 studies. Whereas the global sensitivity, ranging from 64-73%, was comparable, the different physiological properties of the Mab preparations caused marked differences in the imaging capabilities of certain tumor localizations, especially in the liver. All Mab underestimated the extent of liver involvement, however, the highest regional sensitivity (75%) was found with the I131 IMACIS-1. In contrast, Mab with the highest physiological liver uptake (In111 BW 431/31, Tc99m BW 431/26) imaged liver metastases in most cases unspecifically as cold spot, yielding a sensitivity of 0-9%. No differences between the Mab were seen in the regional sensitivity with respect to lung metastases, which ranged between 33-40%. All tested Mab showed a high sensitivity in imaging local recurrences ranging between 50% for the I131 IMACIS-1 and 100% for the Tc99m BW 431/26. We conclude, that in postoperative tumor patients anti-CEA ISC with Tc99m BW 431/26 is the method of choice for the detection of local recurrences.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1990
2075233	Photon-deficient finding in sternum on bone scintigraphy in patients with malignant disease.	The sternum is known as a common site of bone metastasis in a variety of neoplasms. Sternal metastasis is usually visualized as hot spot on bone scintigraphy. However, photon deficiency in the sternum on bone scintigraphy is reported in few cases with malignancy. We undertook a retrospective analysis to clarify the clinical significance of photon deficiency in the sternum in 12 patients with malignancy. Twelve patients (five breast cancer, two multiple myeloma, one lung cancer, one renal cell cancer, one hepatocellular carcinoma, one malignant lymphoma, and one thyroid cancer) showing cold sternal metastasis on bone scintigraphy were identified among 9,430 patients in whom bone scintigraphy was performed. Except for two cases with pathologically confirmed sternal metastasis, all patients showed lytic change in the sternum on tomography or CT scan. Six cases of solitary sternal metastasis showed partial effect of systemic therapy (chemotherapy, humoral therapy, and radiation therapy) and surgical treatment. It is necessary to keep in mind that this type of lesion may occur as a manifestation of metastatic disease.

2262930	Modulation of the estrogen receptor structure, evidence of a heterogeneity.	In order to analyse the molecular weight polymorphism of the estrogen receptor (ER) in MCF-7 cells, we have developed a procedure which allowed in situ linkage of ER by (3H) tamoxifen aziridine and provided labelled proteins in conditions which minimized protease activities. After labelling, cell lysis was performed in SDS buffer containing various concentrations of [symbol: see text]-mercaptoethanol. Proteins extracted with phenolic solution and precipitated by cold acetone were analysed by SDS PAGE. It appears that beside the form of 67 kDa already described, binding entities of tamoxifen aziridine were also present at a molecular mass of 110 kDa and 45 kDa. On the other hand, investigations on the effect of 12-0-Tetradecanoyl Phorbol 13-Acetate (TPA) showed that TPA induces a decrease of the 67 kDa entity.	1990
2593713	Effect of long-term freezer storage, thawing, and refreezing on selected constituents of serum.	We determined the effect of long-term freezer storage and repeated thawing and freezing of serum on concentrations of electrolytes (sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphate), enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase), total protein, tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen and alpha-fetoprotein), and other substances. Vials (1 ml) of frozen serum from a single blood drawing from 40 women with no breast disease and 70 with benign breast disease were analyzed annually from 1983 to 1987. Blood had been obtained from 40 subjects in 1978, 40 in 1980, and 30 in 1983. Thawing and refreezing studies were done in two ways: (1) serum samples from 30 subjects with benign breast disease were thawed at weekly intervals for 6 weeks and (2) serum samples from 30 patients with stage IV breast cancer were analyzed for alpha-fetoprotein and carcinoembryonic antigen, and serum specimens from 23 patients with benign breast disease and 7 control subjects were analyzed for lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase after thawing and keeping the samples at room temperature for up to 4 hours and then refreezing them. For measuring laboratory variability, duplicate samples were processed. Long-term storage (up to 10 years) and repeated thawing and refreezing did not affect the results of any tested constituents of serum. Although most measurements showed statistically significant variability over test cycles, these differences were thought to be due to laboratory variability.	1989
2631030	[Determination of EGF receptors (epidermal growth factor) in the placenta and breast tumors].	Receptors for Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) have been identified in different types of tumors and they are often associated with other characteristics which are related to a bad prognosis. A technic has been established to measure membrane receptors in human placenta, which is appropriate for the study of tumors. Preparations of placental membranes were incubated either with increasing amounts (0.1 to 3.0, 10(-9) M) of EGF labeled with 125I (method by saturation) or with 0.2, 10(-9) M labeled EGF and increasing concentrations (0 to 1.6, 10(-9) M) of cold EGF (method by competition). The KD obtained with both technics are not significantly different: 0.85 and 0.77, 10(-9) M respectively, as well as the maximum binding capacity: 5.9 and 4.4 pmol/mg protein respectively. A preliminary study in breast tumors showed that 2 out of 9 contained significant amounts of receptors (58 and 114 fmol/mg protein). One of these two tumors held both estradiol and progesterone receptors. In the other 7 tumors without EGF receptors only one did not contained any estradiol or progesterone receptors. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relationships between EGF/sex hormone receptor status and the degree of breast tumor malignancy.	1989
2667495	Proliferative activity and steroid receptors determined by immunohistochemistry in adjacent frozen sections of 102 breast carcinomas.	Adjacent frozen sections of 102 consecutive female breast carcinomas were examined for the expression of the Ki-67 antibody-reactive proliferation-associated nuclear antigen and of estrogen and progesterone receptors with the use of monoclonal antibodies and peroxidase histochemistry. The results of steroid receptor stainings were semiquantitatively assessed (histoscore) on the basis of nuclear staining intensity and the percentage of positively stained carcinoma cell nuclei. Carcinomas negative for either receptor had significantly higher percentages of Ki-67-positive cells. The highest percentages of Ki-67-positive cells were observed in carcinomas negative for both estrogen and progesterone receptors. There was a highly significant decrease in receptor histoscores with increasing proliferative cell fractions as determined by Ki-67 positivity. No significant (progesterone receptor) or poor negative correlation (estrogen receptor) was observed when proliferative cell fractions were related to receptor concentrations from conventional steroid-binding assays. Immunoperoxidase staining for the Ki-67 antibody-defined proliferation antigen and steroid receptors in tissue sections provides a simple means to gain information of therapeutic and prognostic importance.	1989
2547346	Immunohistochemical assessment of estrogen and progesterone receptors in stored imprints and cryostat sections of breast carcinomas.	A peroxidase-antiperoxidase technique was used to visualize estrogen and progesterone receptors in stored imprints and cryostat sections of breast carcinomas that were prepared at the time of biopsy or frozen section diagnosis. This was done to provide an alternate technique for the assessment of the receptor status of tumors that could not be adequately assayed with other biochemical or immunocytological methods. Fixation in Zamboni's fixative followed by passage through cold methanol and acetone before storage at -80 C insured good preservation of the receptor proteins over extended periods of time (up to 56 weeks). Immunostaining of these stored preparations with monoclonal antibodies against estrogen receptor (H222) and progesterone receptor (JZB39 and KD68) showed a high degree of correspondence with immunocytochemical assays (ER-ICA and PR-ICA) and biochemical analysis. This technique is easy to perform and provides reliable information, even in tumors that are too small and/or ill defined to permit separate sampling for receptor assays.	1989
2487046	DNA ploidy of human breast cancer.	Ploidy was determined on 663 resectable primary tumors from untreated patients. Nuclei obtained by mechanical disaggregation of frozen tissue were stained with propidium iodide and analysed in a FACS IV. Aneuploidy was detected in 73% of cases. It was not significantly related to nodal involvement or tumor size, although the highest frequencies were observed in large tumors (88%) or with more than 10 positive nodes (77%). Aneuploidy was more frequently observed in ductal infiltrating (81%) than in lobular histology and in tumors lacking both progesterone and estrogen receptors (85%). Analysis of ploidy in primary and synchronous lymph node metastases from the same patient showed a high agreement rate (90%) of DNA patterns simply defined as diploid or aneuploid. However, differences in DNA stemlines and DNA indices between the two synchronous lesions from the same patient were a rather frequent event.	1989
2502514	Effect of freeze-thawing breast milk on vertical HTLV-I transmission from seropositive mothers to children.	Breast feeding is known to be a major cause of vertical transmission of HTLV-I from mothers to her children. The infectiousness of HTLV-I in breast milk was reported to be lost during freezing and thawing processes. We therefore administered frozen-and-thawed breast milk of HTLV-I carriers to their babies. Among the 13 babies given the frozen-and-thawed breast milk (now 12 months of age), no infection has been found yet. This result suggests that freezing and thawing of breast milk is a promising method for the prevention of vertical HTLV-I infection to breast-fed babies.	1989
2668356	A monoclonal antibody, SKH1, reacts with 40 Kd sweat gland-associated antigen.	Several monoclonal antibodies (MAB) have been produced using an eccrine carcinoma cell line as an immunogen. One such MAB, SKH1, reacted with both the secretory portion and coiled duct of the eccrine and with the secretory portion of apocrine gland. SKH1, however, did not react with myoepithelial cells, intradermal ducts of both types of sweat gland, or with other components of normal axillary skin including the epidermis and follicular apparatus. The reaction was strongest if the specimen was fixed with 80% methanol, and moderate on non-fixed or acid-alcohol-fixed specimens. Only weak reaction was obtained on cold acetone-fixed specimens, and reaction was negative with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. SKH1 reacted positively with the cytoskeleton of the eccrine carcinoma cell line, Colo-16 and MCF-7. Applied to pathological skin specimens, SKH1 reacted with the tumor cells of clear cell hidradenoma, syringocystadenoma papilliferum, and extramammary Paget's disease. SKH1 also reacted with the tumor cells of metastatic adenocarcinomas arising from lung, breast and ovary. SKH1 did not react with the majority of tumor cells of eccrine poroma, but reacted with single-layered cells lining narrow ductal lumina. SKH1 did not react with epithelial cells lining cystic or ductal lumina of syringoma, but reacted moderately with the amorphous keratin-like substance filling the lumina. Immunoblot analysis revealed that SKH1 recognizes a 40 Kd sweat gland-associated antigen, and can be an aid to identifying tumors arising from sweat gland structures.	1989
2647290	Immunolymphoscintigraphy for the detection of lymph node metastases from breast cancer.	The presence of metastases in the regional lymph nodes is the major prognostic factor in breast cancer in the absence of overt distant metastases and is also an important indicator of the need for adjuvant therapy in "early" breast cancer. Currently, the accurate assessment of axillary lymph node status requires axillary dissection which has an associated morbidity. An alternative method of identifying patients who are "node positive" has been developed by means of immunolymphoscintigraphy with s.c. administered radioiodinated monoclonal antibody. The 131I-labeled anti-breast cancer antibody (RCC-1; 400 micrograms) and cold iodine-labeled "blocking" antibody (Ly-2.1; 2 mg which is nonreactive with breast cancer) were injected s.c. into both arms and scintigraphy images were obtained 16-18 h after the injection, using the axilla contralateral to the side of the breast cancer as the control. Studies were reported as positive (and therefore indicative of lymph node metastases) if the amount of background-subtracted radioactive count in the axilla of interest exceeded the normal side by a radio equal to or greater than 1.5:1.0 as assessed by computer analysis. In 38 of 40 patients the findings on scintigraphy were correlated with operative and histopathological findings on the axillary dissection specimen or cytological findings of fine needle aspiration of axillary lymph nodes. In a prospective study of 26 patients, the method is more sensitive (86%) and specific (92%) than preoperative clinical assessment (57% sensitivity, 58% specificity) in the detection of axillary lymph node metastases; and by combining both modalities of assessment, there was an improvement in the sensitivity (100%) but a deterioration in the specificity (50%). There was no significant complication from this essentially outpatient procedure and only 1 of 40 patients developed a human anti-mouse antibody response. This novel and safe method of imaging may become a most useful adjunct in the surgical management of breast cancer.	1989
2644015	Immunodetection in fine-needle aspirates and multiparametric (SAMBA) image analysis. Receptors (monoclonal antiestrogen and antiprogesterone) and growth fraction (monoclonal Ki67) evaluation in breast carcinomas.	Immunocytochemical assays (ICA) using monoclonal antiestrogen receptors (ER ICA), antiprogesterone receptors (PR ICA), and monoclonal antibody Ki67 (Ki67 ICA) were performed in 127 breast carcinomas. The immunostaining procedures were applied on frozen tissue sections, tumour imprints, and fine-needle aspirates in order to compare the variations in the distribution of the antigens detected in the three different types of preparations. Positive reactions detected with peroxidase-antiperoxidase and avidinbiotin-peroxidase, and alkaline phosphatase-antialkaline phosphatase complexes were evaluated through a computerized system of image analysis referred to as SAMBA 200 (SAMBA TITN, Grenoble, France). Application programs specifically developed for the analysis of tissue sections and of cytologic preparations were applied. This system allowed a multiparametric, accurate, reliable, reproducible and automatized evaluation of the heterogeneity of the antigenic sites in tumors. For each markers positive cell surface (PS), and integrated and mean optical densities (IOD, MOD) and IOD histograms were compared. It was shown that (1) there was no significant variation in optical densities in cell imprints and aspirates whereas PS significantly (P less than 0.01) differed in both preparations; (2) there were significant differences of the optical densities between tissue sections and cytological preparations, either imprints or aspirates, likely due to randomly cut nuclei in tissue sections; and (3) there was a significant difference between the PS of tissue sections and aspirates but no significant difference between tissue sections and imprints. It is concluded that fine-needle aspiration constitutes a convenient method for cell sampling, reliable for the diagnosis of malignancies. However, it may not reflect the heterogeneity of cell subpopulations in tissue.	1989
2538871	[Sonography and cytology of cold thyroid nodules].	270 patients with a scintigraphically cold thyroid nodule of sonographically increased (n = 34), diminished (n = 72) or neutral (n = 86) echogenity or cystic criteria (n = 78) were subjected to fine needle aspiration biopsy. This revealed unequivocal malignancy in 8 and follicular neoplasia in another 30 patients, 10 of whom proved to have malignomas on further evaluation. A total of 12 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas, 2 non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 1 sarcoma and the metastasis of a breast carcinoma were diagnosed. The most sensitive criteria for malignancy were diminished echogenity, an inhomogeneous echo pattern and the occurrence of a solitary nodule. The incidence of malignancy was increased among males but not among especially young persons. There was no sonographic feature that would permit omission of fine needle aspiration.	1989
2468075	[Immunocytochemical staining of estrogen receptor in conventional formalin-fixed paraffin sections in human breast cancer].	Immunocytochemical staining for estrogen receptor (ER) was examined in conventional formalin-fixed paraffin sections in 63 patients with breast cancer. The ER staining was performed by avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method (ABC) using monoclonal antibody against ER (H222). The ER stainability in formalin-fixed paraffin sections was compared with the levels of ER measuring dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) method, and with the stainability of ER in frozen sections. ER positive rates of paraffin sections and frozen sections were 52%, and 65% respectively. ER positive level of DCC method was seen in 62 percent of the cases. Results of ER staining in paraffin sections correlated well to those of DCC method and to those of ER staining in frozen sections. In paraffin sections as well as in frozen sections, ER staining was located at the nuclei of cancer cells. Furthermore, the variety that this method for ER can be used for retrospective studies of ER on stored blocks of breast cancer.	1989
3190248	[Prevention of adriamycin-induced alopecia by scalp hypothermia with a deep-frozen Duncool-Cap].	In order to prevent Adriamycin (ADM)-induced alopecia, scalp hypothermia with a Duncool-Cap frozen in a freezer at -70 degrees C was carried out. Of the 18 patients studied, one patient given total ADM doses of 240 mg developed alopecia of moderate degree, and another patient treated with ADM at a dose level of 50 mg developed mild alopecia. Alopecia could be almost completely prevented in 10 of the 11 patients given total ADM doses of 100 mg or less, and in 6 of the 7 patients given total doses of 200 mg or more.	1988
2459958	Immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor protein in paraffin sections. Effects of enzymatic pretreatment and cobalt chloride intensification.	Monoclonal antibodies provide important tools for the demonstration of estrogen receptors (ERs) in cases of breast cancer. This study reports an improved immunohistochemical method for the demonstration of ER in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples using the Abbott monoclonal antibody to ER protein. Tissue sections were pretreated briefly with trypsin, followed by DNase before the performance of the immunohistochemical reaction and cobalt chloride was used to intensify the color of the diaminobenzidine reaction product. In 20 cases, the results in paraffin sections were compared with biochemical assays with the dextran-coated charcoal technique or with immunohistochemistry performed on frozen sections. There was an excellent correlation between the results obtained with all three methods. The introduction of cobalt chloride into the chromogen solution significantly increased the sensitivity of this approach as compared with the use of diaminobenzidine alone.	1988
3263077	Cytolysis of mammary tumor targets by resting, interleukin-2 stimulated and in vitro cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes from breast cancer patients.	The cytotoxic capacity of resting, interleukin-2 (IL-2)-stimulated and in vitro cultured (3-5 days in 10 U/ml IL-2 containing media) peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) from breast cancer patients to a panel of established mammary tumor cell lines was ascertained. Significant cytolysis (ranging from 7.8 to 12.4%, at an effector: target ratio of 20:1) of all mammary tumor targets (MCF-7, 734B, ZR-75-1, ZR-75-30, BT-20 and Hs578T) by PBLs was demonstrable in 18 h chromium release assays. Natural killer (NK) cytotoxicity was distinct from IL-2 stimulated (5 U/ml) and in vitro cultured PBL cytotoxicity in that resting PBLs were not cytolytic to RAJI cells, normal breast epithelia (Hs578Bst) and fibroblasts. Basal NK activity against mammary tumor targets was significantly reduced in patients receiving chemotherapy when compared to both untreated patients and normal controls. In criss-cross cold target inhibition studies, ZR-75-1 and K562 targets were not mutually competitive in NK cell assays (using resting PBLs) but were mutually competitive in lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) assays (using in vitro cultured PBLs). In eleven independent experiments, basal NK activity of ZR-75-1 cells was increased by a cold target excess of K562 (8.2 +/- 2.4% vs 30.5 +/- 5.2%, mean +/- SE, p greater than 0.01, cold:hot target ratio = 10:1). Interestingly, no such parallel increase of cytolysis of 734B targets by K562 cells was observed. Basal cytotoxicity against ZR-75-1 and K562 targets was serologically depleted using antibodies to natural killer cells HNK-1 and Leu 11b. Thus mammary tumor cell lines parallel autologous tumor cells, yet show features that are distinct from NK-resistant and sensitive lymphoid cell lines in their susceptibility to natural resistant cytolytic mechanisms.
3379955	Progesterone receptor quantification with radiolabeled promegestone (R 5020) in frozen sections of endometrium and breast cancer tissue.	A technique for the determination of the progesterone receptor content at sections was developed. Series of coverglass-mounted unfixed frozen sections were incubated with [3H]R5020 only, to determine total binding, or with excess unlabeled R5020, to determine non-specific binding. Ligand binding in the tissue sections was measured by liquid scintillation counting after repeated washing of the coverslips. Elution of ligand binding proteins into the incubation buffer was quantitated with the dextran-coated charcoal method. Specific ligand binding was related to the total tissue protein content which was determined on parallel, unmounted sections. Scatchard analysis showed specific saturable and high affinity (Kd = 0.01-2 nM) section-bound and soluble binding sites in cryostat sections of calf uterus, human endometrium and breast cancer samples. Ligand specificity was studied by competition of [3H]R5020 with a 100-fold excess of various steroid receptor ligands. The competition was excellent for R5020 and progesterone, negligible for estrogens and slight for androgens and corticosteroids. These binding characteristics provide evidence that with this assay progesterone receptors are determined. Exchange experiments showed that with this method total, free as well as occupied, progesterone receptors can be measured. A highly significant linear correlation, and agreement in PR status classification between assay on cytosol and sections was obtained for a series of 21 breast cancer samples. Finally, progesterone receptor analysis using cryostat sections results in the recovery of 2-3 times more PR from the same amount of tissue as compared to the use of cytosol. These results indicate that progesterone receptors can be reliably assayed with Scatchard analysis using cryostat sections, which requires less tissue than the cytosol assay. This method, which is simple and easy to perform could be of practical importance, particularly when only small tissue samples (which also have to be analyzed morphologically or histochemically) are available and when quantitative radiochemical progesterone receptor data are required for direct comparison with (immuno-) histochemical information.	1988
3169098	Cardiotoxicity of mitozantrone assessed by stress and resting nuclear ventriculography.	Fourteen patients with advanced breast cancer were treated with a combination of vincristine, mitozantrone and prednisolone. Before, during and after cessation of treatment radionuclide assessment of ventricular performance was obtained at rest, in response to cold pressor-induced stress and on recovery from stress. Six of 14 patients (46%) developed abnormalities of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). One patient developed clinical signs of cardiac failure. Mitozantrone is an active agent in the treatment of advanced breast cancer but it can produce cardiotoxicity. In this particular middle-aged population, changes in LVEF occurred over a wide range of cumulative doses. Further investigation is required to determine the nature and prognosis of this iatrogenic toxicity.	1988
2451827	Binding of antiestrogens exposes an occult antigenic determinant in the human estrogen receptor.	Treatment of human breast cancer cytosol with tamoxifen (Tam) or 4-monohydroxytamoxifen (MHT) enhances the immunoreactivity of the estrogen receptor toward monoclonal antibody H222 but not monoclonal antibodies D547 or D75. This effect is evident from an increase in the apparent receptor content measured by the Abbott enzyme immunoassay, which uses peroxidase-labeled H222 as the chromogenic marker, and in the rate and size of the sedimentation peak of the immune complex of the receptor with radiolabeled H222. In contrast, MHT shows no effect in reversed immunoassay systems that use peroxidase-labeled D547 or D75 as chromogenic markers, nor does it affect the sedimentation peak of the complex of D547 with the receptor. MHT can exert its action on receptor bound to immobilized antibody. These results indicate that reaction with antiestrogens causes a change, probably conformational, in the receptor protein that exposes an occult antigenic determinant recognized uniquely by H222. Since this can occur in cytosol previously treated with excess estradiol in the cold, it appears to result from an interaction of antiestrogens with a region of the receptor distinct from the estrogen-binding site, suggesting that agonist and antagonist actions may involve different parts of the receptor molecule.	1988
3358637	Influence of practice on the biochemical analysis of steroid receptors in human breast cancer.	The value of experience and practice in the routine biochemical analysis of steroid receptors was studied in 2576 different primary breast cancer specimens over five consecutive years. The positivity rate (beyond 3 fm/protein) and the measured concentrations of the steroid receptors increase. The positivity rate and average steroid receptor concentration of the samples immediately frozen is significantly higher compared to the overall sample population. It is concluded that the handling of the specimen before freezing and the experience of the technician play an important role in the routine biochemical analysis of steroid receptors.
3269362	Cytotoxic T cell clones against human autologous cancers: analysis of target antigen and the mechanism of specific target cell destruction.	The human autologous pair of a cytotoxic T cell clone and tumor line could be very useful for the investigation of the specific destruction of autologous tumor cells by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), including analysis for tumor-specific antigen possibly of the rejection type, clonotypic T cell antigen receptors and biochemical characteristics of the cytotoxic molecules produced from CTL. We established such a pair of autologous specific CTL clone TcHMC-1 and target clone HMC-1-8 that were derived from the metastatic pleural effusion of a patient with mammary carcinoma. TcHMC-1 showed more than 60% specific cytotoxicity against HMC-1-8, and it was confirmed, using cold target inhibition assays, that this clone did not demonstrate nonspecific cytotoxicity against a allogeneic targets as well as the natural killer (NK) cell activity. We also confirmed the in vivo action of TcHMC-1 against HMC-1-8 cells by the Winn assay in nude mice. Using anti-CD3, 4, and 8 as well as anti-class I monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), it was demonstrated that T cell antigen receptor molecule complexes Ti/T3 on TcHMC-1 and corresponding specific tumor antigens on HMC-1-8 are involved in the cytotoxicity under the restriction of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I products. We developed mAb 3A2 reacting with the specific antigens on HMC-1-8 that could play an important role in this autologous pair. This mAb inhibited selectively the cytotoxic action of TcHMC-1 against HMC-1-8, and identified a molecule with approximately 92 kd m.w. 3A2-defined antigen was highly expressed on autologous primary breast carcinoma tissue, but not on normal mammary gland in the same patient. Moreover, this antigen can be detected on approximately 50% of human allogeneic breast carcinomas, but not on other neoplastic cells except for 1 out of 10 prostatic carcinomas. It was also suggested that 3A2-defined antigen is not murine mammary tumor virus-related antigen.	1988
2961640	Partial characterization of somatomedin C-like immunoreactivity secreted by breast cancer cells in vitro.	The in vitro secretion of immunoreactive somatomedin C/insulin-like growth factor I (IR Sm-C/IGF-I) by two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF-7 and EVSA-T has been studied. IR Sm-C/IGF-I concentration showed a linear increase in serum-free culture media over 72 h of incubation for both cell lines, and a close correlation with cell number (P less than 0.001). To characterize this immunoreactivity, a pool of conditioned media collected after 72 h of incubation was dialyzed overnight against 1 M acetic acid, lyophilized, and gel filtered on a Sephadex G-50 column. Fractions were determined for Sm-C/IGF-I content and for the presence of a specific carrier for Sm-C/IGF-I. Two peaks of Sm-C/IGF-I-like immunoreactivity were evidenced, the first in the high molecular weight region and the second corresponding to the molecular weight of the free peptide. The first peak evidenced also a specific binding ability for radioiodinated Sm-C/IGF-I, suggesting that the activity found in this region could be interpreted as interference of the specific free binding sites in the immunoassay. Analysis of this peak by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated the presence of a specific binding for Sm-C/IGF-I in a molecular weight range between 35,000 and 45,000 Da, which was not modified in reducing conditions. The binding activity was competitively inhibited by addition of cold Sm-C/IGF-I but not by insulin excess.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1987
2825511	Intraoperative diagnosis of breast lesions. Comparison of cytologic with frozen section technics.	A retrospective double-blind examination of the cytologic smears and frozen section tissue slides from 140 lesions of the breast was performed in order to assess the diagnostic accuracy of each method. The cases with diagnostic errors were reevaluated to define the pitfalls encountered in the intraoperative diagnosis of breast lesions by both methods. Results with the cytologic technics are more variable than with frozen sections, but when read by experienced observers the smears are as accurate as frozen sections and have the additional advantages of rapidity, sparing of tissue for other studies, better correlation with fine-needle aspiration cytologic results, and more complete sampling of large or multiple specimens. The authors recommend that intraoperative cytologic examination be employed routinely in breast diagnosis, initially always in conjunction with frozen section examination but eventually in many cases as an alternative technic.	1987

3039542	X-ray characterisation of normal and neoplastic breast tissues.	Normal and neoplastic breast tissues have been characterised in terms of x-ray attenuation. Samples of normal fat and fibrous tissue were obtained from reduction mammoplasty and autopsy, and infiltrating duct carcinoma specimens from mastectomy and lumpectomy. A high-purity germanium spectroscopy system and a beam of 120 kV constant potential x-rays were used to determine the linear attenuation coefficient from 18 to 110 keV. Densities were determined from buoyancy measurements and were used to obtain mass attenuation coefficients. Infiltrating duct carcinomas and fat are well distinguished by x-ray attenuation. For photon energies used for film-screen mammography, infiltrating duct carcinomas are more attenuating than fibrous tissue. Above 31 keV, the ranges of attenuation of the two tissue types overlap. The attenuation coefficients of tissues have been concisely represented by equivalent thicknesses of lucite and aluminium. Analysis based on the average attenuation properties of tissues indicates that dual-energy mammography, using an ideal imaging system, would require 0.06 cGy to provide images in which 1 cm infiltrating duct carcinomas are displayed with a signal to noise ratio of 5 against a background over which the fat/fibrous contrast has been suppressed. This dose is similar to that currently used in conventional film-screen mammography.	1987
3776909	Adriamycin alopecia prevented by cold air scalp cooling.	Preliminary studies are reported on the effectiveness of cold air scalp cooling to prevent alopecia in patients receiving Adriamycin. Cold air produced in a novel way using a vortex refrigeration tube was applied to the scalp for 15 min before and 30 min after the administration of Adriamycin and other cytotoxic agents. Sixteen of 26 patients had no hair loss, four had slight hair loss, and six required a wig. Two subgroups fared particularly well. Four of four patients treated with ABVD for Hodgkin's disease and nine of 13 treated with Adriamycin (40 mg/m2) and vincristine (2 mg) for breast cancer had no hair loss.	1986
2877963	Prevention of HTLV-I transmission through the breast milk by a freeze-thawing process.	Fifteen human breast milk samples obtained from mothers seropositive for human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I (HTLV-I) antigen were kept frozen overnight at -20 degrees. Each milk sample was then co-cultivated with cord lymphocytes obtained from 15 anti-HTLV-I antibody-negative mothers. No HTLV-I antigen-positive cells were detected among the cord lymphocytes subjected to co-cultivation. These results suggest that thawing of frozen breast milk may prevent HTLV-I transmission from mother to child via breast milk.	1986
3488124	Specific cytotoxicity of a long-term cultured T-cell clone on human autologous mammary cancer cells.	We established an autologous specific T-cell killer clone, TcHMC-1, that has been cultured and has retained its function for over 1 year. TcHMC-1 and target cells (HMC-1-8) were derived from the metastatic pleural effusion of a patient with mammary carcinoma. At culture initiation, pleural exudative lymphocytes (PLEL) already demonstrated a high cytotoxic activity against uncloned HMC-1 breast tumor cell targets but not against autologous fibroblasts and K562 targets, and phenotypically these cells showed 100 and 90% reactivity with OKT3 and OKT8 monoclonal antibodies, respectively. However, at the early phase of cultivation under interleukin 2, PLEL had a relatively high cytotoxicity against some allogeneic tumor cells. Furthermore, the longer these PLEL were cultured with interleukin 2 and stimulated with MMC-treated HMC-1, the less cytotoxic activity of PLEL against HMC-1 targets became. We then cloned PLEL as well as HMC-1 tumor cells, and an autologous pair of TcHMC-1 and a target cell clone, HMC-1-8, was successfully obtained. TcHMC-1 showed more than 60% specific cytotoxicity against HMC-1-8, and it was confirmed, using cold target inhibition assays, that TcHMC-1 did not demonstrate nonspecific cytotoxicity against allogeneic targets as well as the natural killer cell activity. Moreover, we examined the in vivo action of TcHMC-1 against HMC-1-8 cells by the Winn assay using nude mice. The data showed that s.c. injections with a mixture of TcHMC-1 and HMC-1-8 clearly resulted in a failure of tumor development in the nude mice even 12 weeks after injections, whereas mice given injections of HMC-1-8 and allogeneic T-lymphocytes cultured with interleukin 2 developed tumors. The autologous pair of a killer T-cell clone and tumor line could be very useful for future investigations of the specific destruction of autologous tumor cells by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes, including analysis for tumor-specific antigens possibly of rejection type and clonotypic T-cell antigen receptors.	1986
3021377	Colon carcinoma metastatic to the thyroid gland.	Metastatic carcinoma to the thyroid gland rarely is encountered in clinical practice; however, autopsy series have shown that it is not a rare occurrence. A case of adenocarcinoma of the colon with metastases to the thyroid is reported. A review of the literature reveals that melanoma, breast, renal, and lung carcinomas are the most frequent tumors to metastasize to the thyroid. Metastatic disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis of cold nodules on radionuclide thyroid scans, particularly in patients with a known primary.	1986
2425948	Detection of estrophilin in frozen sections of breast cancers using an estrogen receptor immunocytochemical assay.	Estrogen receptor (ER) was detected in frozen sections of 36 breast carcinomas using an antiestrophilin monoclonal antibody according to an immunocytochemical technique elaborated and made available by Abbott Laboratories in the form of a kit (ER-immunocytochemical assay monoclonal). Immunostaining was confined to the nuclei of the carcinoma cells. In all positive specimens, nuclei with different staining intensities were present in addition to a variable number of unstained nuclei, presumably because of functional heterogeneity. Of the 36 carcinomas, 27 displayed positive immunostaining, 4 had no staining, and in 5 the staining was borderline. All specimens were assayed for ER content by the dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) technique. When the DCC values were compared with the results of immunostaining it was found that 4 tumors were negative and 27 were positive by both techniques, whereas of 5 cases with borderline staining 3 were negative by DCC and 2 had low DCC values. These correlations proved to be highly significant (P much less than 0.001). The number of stained nuclei (extent of staining) related to the DCC status in a significant manner (P less than 0.01), whereas the intensity of staining did not (P greater than 0.10). These results indicate that immunocytochemical visualization of ER using Abbott's "ER-Immunocytochemical Assay Monoclonal" kit is an easy, reproducible, and reliable technique.	1986

3081261	Demonstration of human breast carcinoma cells in cryosections and primary monolayer cultures of surgical biopsies by neotetrazolium reductase cytochemistry.	The present study describes a cytochemical approach to demonstrate human breast carcinoma cells in cryosections and in primary monolayer cultures from surgical biopsies. The material consisted of biopsies from 52 carcinomas and 29 benign lesions. Cryosections and cultures were incubated to demonstrate NADPH-neotetrazolium reductase in an atmosphere of 99.5% oxygen. Incubation time and section thickness were adjusted to accomplish the same level of reaction in cells of cryosections and corresponding cultures. Positive reaction was thus confined to epithelial elements and to the wall of some smaller blood vessels. More than one-half of the carcinoma cells showed moderate to strong reaction in cryosections from 29 of 52 carcinomas whereas no reaction was seen in ductules of normal appearance adjacent to these carcinoma cells. Positive reaction was seen in epithelial cell islets in primary cultures of 16 of the 40 carcinomas cultured. In cryosections from fibroadenomas and fibrocystic disease specimens only apocrine metaplasia consistently showed positive reactions compared with less than 10% of other ductular profiles in a given cryosection. This pattern of reaction was reflected in the derived primary cultures in which positive reaction was found in epithelial cell islets in only one of 19 biopsies cultured. The presence of human milk fat globule membrane antigen was used to demonstrate the epithelial nature of the cell islets seen in cultures of biopsies from both benign lesions and carcinomas. NADPH-neotetrazolium reductase positive islets from carcinoma biopsies were frequently aneuploid whereas most negative islets from carcinoma biopsies were diploid as were all islets from benign tissues.	1986
2868909	Reconstitution of human hematopoietic function with autologous cryopreserved circulating stem cells.	Complete hematopoietic reconstitution using nonleukemic peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been achieved in animal models but not in humans. We treated two patients who had metastatic breast carcinoma involving the bone marrow and who had failed conventional therapy with high-dose chemotherapy and total body radiation. Cryopreserved autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells (6.3-8.4 X 10(8)/kg patient weight) obtained by leukapheresis before high-dose therapy were returned to the patients intravenously. In one patient, evidence of bone marrow engraftment was present, but the patient died before full reconstitution of the peripheral blood cells occurred. Bone marrow engraftment and return of all cell lines to the peripheral blood occurred in the second patient. These findings demonstrate that human hematopoietic reconstitution can be achieved with autologous, peripheral blood, mononuclear cell transfusions following high-dose therapy. This approach may be useful to patients who have contraindications for a bone marrow harvest but who are otherwise candidates for autologous bone marrow transplantation.	1986
3949578	A 192Ir nomogram system for single plane implants.	Nomograms for square planar arrays spanning the range from 3 X 3 cm to 10 X 10 cm were developed. The nomograms are intended to be used for pretreatment planning of implant geometry, so that the therapist may enter the operating room with a plan for the optimal implant in mind. We show that clinically useful implants are those in which the reference isodoses are fully coupled. Decoupling occurs when ribbon spacing exceeds approximately 1.2 cm and leads to undesirable "cold spots" within the treatment volume. Ribbon spacing of 1.0 cm is recommended. This represents a trade-off between adequate ribbon coupling and minimum tissue damage from trocar placement. For clinically useful arrays, the area enclosed by the reference isodose contour (85% of the maximum dose rate) is approximately 50% of the array area. Reference isodose contour and its enclosed area are independent of seed strength for a given array, as long as all seeds within the array are of equal strength.	1986
3517622	Specificity of the monoclonal anti-I antibody (Hy).	In previous work we found that a monoclonal cold hemagglutinin from patient Hy strongly bound antigens contained in stage IV breast cancer sera. To infer the chemical structure of the antigens expressed in the cancer sera, we studied the specificity of the antibody (Hy). The antibody (Hy) had I specificity, based on agglutination scores with adult and cord red blood cells. The binding of the antibody to synthetic and milk oligosaccharides was determined using a solid phase enzyme immunoassay (EIA). The anti-I antibody (Hy) strongly bound LacNAc0-Me, LacNAc1----6Gal, LacNAc1----6 (LacNAc1----3)Gal, LacNAc-1----6 alpha GalNAc, LacNAc1----3LacNAc, and LacNAc, 0.05, 0.06, 0.09, 0.22, 0.35 and 0.75 mM giving 50% inhibition, respectively. The anti-I antibody (Hy), similar to the anti-I antibody (Ma), strongly bound LacNAc1----6Gal, but it differed from the anti-I antibody (Ma) in its cross-reactivity with the i sequence. The anti-I antibody (Hy) showed similar reactivities as the hybridoma monoclonal antibodies M18 and M39 with LacNAc1----6Gal and with the i-active sequence. The EIA procedure is a useful alternative to either radioimmunoassay or immunoprecipitation method in the study of anti-I,i specificities.	1986

2996751	Correlation of steroid receptors with histologic differentiation in mammary carcinoma. A Singapore experience.	Cancer of the breast is the most common tumor in females in Singapore, with the rate of 20.7 per 100,000 per year (1977 estimate), which is predicted to increase to 29.8 per 100,000 women per year by 1995. A detailed histopathologic review of 50 primary breast cancer tumors analyzed for estrogen receptor (ER) level was carried out and a variety of morphologic features correlated with ER results to identify any factors that will improve the management and prognosis for breast cancer. Cytosol was incubated with 3H-estradiol in the presence and absence of cold diethylstilbestrol, and bound and free hormone were separated by Dextran-coated charcoal method. Tumors binding more than 5 fmol/mg cytosol protein were classified as ER-positive. Progesterone receptor (PR) level was analyzed in some specimens with the use of a similar method. Most of the patients were Chinese (90%). Three patients were Malays, one was Indian, and one was European in this series. Results indicated that there was strong correlation between ER level, age, and histologic grade of the tumors. No correlation existed between absence or presence of lymph node metastases and ER. Although there was a trend for ER-positive tumors to have a low-grade lymphocytic infiltration, the difference was not statistically significant.	1985
2992882	Cryolumpectomy for breast cancer: an experimental study.	The effects of cryosurgical procedures and surgical excision in preventing the local recurrence of mammary adenocarcinoma were studied in BALB/cfC3H mice carrying syngeneic, virus-induced mammary adenocarcinomas transplanted into the fourth mammary fat pad. In this report we present evidence demonstrating that cryosurgical procedures involving multiple freeze-thaw cycles followed by tumor excision markedly reduce the local recurrence rate of mouse mammary cancer. Surgical resection without cryotreatment resulted in an 80% local recurrence rate; in contrast, cryotreatment consisting of three freeze-thaw cycles before excision prevented local tumor recurrence in 70% of the animals. The use of cryotherapy and local excision (cryolumpectomy) in the treatment of human breast cancer is discussed.	1985
4017800	Short-term cryopreservation of human breast carcinoma cells for flow cytometry.	A procedure is described for short-term cryopreservation of primary human tumor cells and tissue slices for later analysis by flow cytometry. Cells were mechanically dispersed into a freezing medium, which was then frozen at either -20 degrees C or -70 degrees C for delayed cell cycle analysis. The results show that a correlation coefficient of greater than 0.95 exists between cell cycle kinetic analyses performed immediately after surgical excision of the tumor and on cells frozen from 1 to 30 days at -70 degrees C in this freezing solution. Somewhat lower levels of correlation exist for cells frozen at -20 degrees C in this freezing medium. This procedure has also been successfully used to preserve freshly isolated breast carcinoma cells shipped from distant laboratories for analysis in the flow cytometer, thus expanding the data base on certain types of breast carcinoma.	1985
3860824	Immunocytochemical staining of estrogen receptor in paraffin sections of human breast cancer by use of monoclonal antibody: comparison with that in frozen sections.	Estrogen receptor (ER) in human breast cancer tissues was demonstrated in paraffin sections as well as in frozen sections by immunoperoxidase methods using monoclonal antibody (H222) against ER. The avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method was used for the paraffin sections fixed in cold buffered formalin, and the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method was used for the fixed frozen sections. The results were compared with the ER content in the respective tumor tissue determined by dextran-coated charcoal assay. The specific staining for ER was located exclusively in the nuclei of cancer cells in both paraffin and frozen sections. Differences in the intensity and distribution of nuclear staining within a section were often observed, suggesting heterogeneity of the ER content of individual breast cancer cells. In 24 breast cancer tissues studied simultaneously by both paraffin and frozen section methods, 21 (88%) showed similar evaluation of the presence of ER. The results of immunocytochemical staining agreed with those of the dextran-coated charcoal assay in 89 (82%) of the 109 paraffin-sectioned tumor tissues and in 24 (86%) of the 28 frozen-sectioned tissues, indicating that ER can be demonstrated immunocytochemically by use of paraffin as well as frozen sections.	1985
3897620	["Cryotherapy" (in general surgery and related areas)].	Application of the extremely low temperature to medicine, essential of cryotherapy/cryosurgery is a "High Energy Treatment", excellent in cost benefit. Tissue temperature of -50 degrees C or tissue impedance of 500 k omega can destroy the tumor. Cryosurgery provides dual prominent features: in situ destruction of the tumor which otherwise are difficult to treat, and the potential tumor-specific immunotherapy. Thus cryotherapy/cryosurgery should be incorporated into the multi-disciplinary regimen against cancer. Future problems include: clinical application of cryoimmunotherapy or cryoimmunointensification therapy, endoscopic cryosurgery as a closed surgery, and cryochemotherapy, a new mode of treatment.	1985
3856048	Response to doxorubicin of cultured normal and cancerous human mammary epithelial cells.	Epithelial cells were isolated and cultured from a number of human mammary specimens of both cancerous and noncancerous origin. Doxorubicin (Dx) sensitivity was measured at second passage with the use of a highly efficient clonogenic assay. For 23 different tumor specimens derived from patients without previous chemotherapy, the drug concentrations required to kill 50% of the cells varied approximately 35-fold. In contrast, for 11 tumor specimens from patients who relapsed after regimens containing Dx, the drug concentration for 50% survival varied only fivefold and the dose-response curves for these specimens clustered at the more resistant end of the spectrum. A wide range of sensitivities was also observed among 13 noncancerous mammary specimens; however, tumor tissue and noncancerous tissue from the same donor were similar. When cultures were subjected to drug incubation periods of 1 and 4 hours, dose-response curves were superimposable when plotted as a function of drug concentration multiplied by time.	1985
3965156	In vivo and in vitro metabolism of the new anticancer drug bisantrene.	The metabolism of bisantrene, a new anthracene anticancer agent active in the treatment of disseminated breast cancer, was studied in vitro using rat liver S9 preparations and in vivo in patients receiving the drug as treatment for their cancers. 14C-ring labeled bisantrene (248 mCi/40 mg) plus cold bisantrene were administered IV to cancer patients (260-340 mg/m2). Fractional urine samples were collected at various time intervals up to 120 h after drug administration and analyzed by HPLC. The percent of total 14C excreted as unchanged parent drug per ml urine ranged from 37 to 79% in the 0 to 24 h samples. The remainder of the radioactivity appeared chromatographically just prior to the bisantrene peak, indicating that compounds more polar than the parent were present as transformation products. Metabolism of bisantrene was also studied in vitro under oxic (O2) and hypoxic (N2) conditions, using commercially available Aroclor 1254 induced rat liver S9 preparations. Following N2 incubation at 37 degrees C for 1 h there was no evidence of metabolism, whereas there was more than 50% decrease in parent drug within 1 h following O2 incubation in the presence of NADPH generating system, suggesting that the metabolic process involves an oxidative reduction. HPLC chromatogram profiles of the mixtures exposed to the activated S9 system indicated that there were at least 3 polar metabolites. In vitro human tumor clonogenic assay showed that the biological activity of bisantrene decreased greater than 4-fold when the drug was incubated with S9 preparations in the presence of NADPH and O2, indicating that the transformation process leads to relatively inactive bisantrene metabolites.	1985
6516423	[Pneumatic cold cap for the prevention of doxorubicin-induced alopecia].	Since 1973 several methods were described in the literature to prevent Doxorubicin induced alopecia. Besides the application of pressure scalp hypothermia gained increasing importance. Various modifications of scalp hypothermia were developed which are expensive and not easy in the handling so far. We are introducing a method in which a pneumatic cap is used for the application of ice on the scalp. With this method which is comperatively cheap and easy to be handled we got a protective effect against doxorubicin-induced hair loss which was at least as efficient as the current results with other methods referred in the literature.	1984
6329663	Relationship between internalization and calcitonin-induced receptor loss in T 47D cells.	Exposure of T 47D human breast cancer cells to salmon calcitonin (sCT) resulted in a reduction of binding capacity for [125I]iodo-sCT in washed cells. The reduction was both time and concentration dependent. Recovery of binding capacity in CT-pretreated T 47D cells occurred in the absence of CT, but was prevented by inhibitors of protein synthesis. Studies were carried out to determine the mechanism of CT-induced reduction of binding capacity. When T 47D cells were treated with sCT at 37 C or 4 C and washed with buffer at neutral pH, subsequently measured binding capacity was lost as a function of time of pretreatment. Cells pretreated under the same conditions were washed with isotonic buffer at pH 2.5 to release cell-surface bound sCT and to allow assessment of cell surface receptor concentration. It was found that at 37 C sCT induced a time-dependent loss of cell surface receptors, so that initially the lost binding capacity was largely reclaimable by acid treatment, whereas after longer exposure to sCT, acid treatment was much less effective in regenerating binding capacity. The CT-induced reduction in binding capacity was not observed when cells were pretreated with sCT at 4 C or in the presence of inhibitors of cellular metabolic energy. These results are consistent with the view that initially CT-induced loss of CT receptors in T 47D cells is primarily due to occupancy of cell-surface receptors and later to a reduction in the concentration of cell-surface receptors mediated by an energy requiring internalization process involving the CT-receptor complex; reappearance of receptors requires new protein synthesis.	1984
6722773	New storage procedure for human tumor biopsies prior to estrogen receptor measurement.	Breast tumor biopsies required for steroid receptor determination are normally frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until assay. However, some limitations of this type of storage exist. To try to both eliminate the need for liquid nitrogen and as part of a study of serial assays on a single tumor biopsy, alternative storage media were investigated. This study shows that storage of breast tumor biopsies at -20 degrees in sucrose buffer made 50% in glycerol prevented the tissues from freezing, yet retained the specific estrogen receptor content both quantitatively and in terms of molecular form (8S:4S ratio). Receptor was stable for up to 100 days, and individual samples could be successfully reassayed throughout this period. Forty-four biopsies from 40 patients were halved, and one section from each was stored in liquid nitrogen, while the other was stored in sucrose:glycerol. Overall, the correlation of receptor content between the two storage methods was good. Using a clinical cutoff value of 20 fmol/mg cytosol protein, only one sample of the 44 would have been classified differently after storage in the two media. Progesterone receptor in biopsies stored in sucrose:glycerol also appears to be stable for at least a limited period.	1984

6230219	Vitamin therapy in the absence of obvious deficiency. What is the evidence?	Vitamins are a group of organic compounds occurring naturally in food and are necessary for good health. Lack of a vitamin may lead to a specific deficiency syndrome, which may be primary (due to inadequate diet) or secondary (due to malabsorption or to increased metabolic need), and it is rational to use high-dose vitamin supplementation in situations where these clinical conditions exist. However, pharmacological doses of vitamins are claimed to be of value in a wide variety of conditions which have no, or only a superficial, resemblance to the classic vitamin deficiency syndromes. The enormous literature on which these claims are based consists mainly of uncontrolled clinical trials or anecdotal reports. Only a few studies have made use of the techniques of randomisation and double-blinding. Evidence from such studies reveals a beneficial therapeutic effect of vitamin E in intermittent claudication and fibrocystic breast disease and of vitamin C in pressure sores, but the use of vitamin A in acne vulgaris, vitamin E in angina pectoris, hyperlipidaemia and enhancement of athletic capacity, of vitamin C in advanced cancer, and niacin in schizophrenia has been rejected. Evidence is conflicting or inconclusive as to the use of vitamin C in the common cold, asthma and enhancement of athletic capacity, of pantothenic acid in osteoarthritis, and folic acid (folacin) in neural tube defects. Most of the vitamins have been reported to cause adverse effects when ingested in excessive doses. It is therefore worthwhile to consider the risk-benefit ratio before embarking upon the use of high-dose vitamin supplementation for disorders were proof of efficacy is lacking.	1984

6428132	Present status of estrogen-receptor cytochemistry and its application in breast cancer research.	Estradiol-BSA-FITC is an hydrophilic macromolecular analog used as a cytochemical marker of estrogen-binding sites. Because of the size of the molecule it seems that the reaction must be carried out on fresh-frozen cryostat sections. The freezing technique affects stainability, even as the freezing temperature. Post-fixation is used or not; the influence of various fixatives is variously interpreted. Thawing of the sections influences the intensity and localization of fluorescence. The concentration of E-BSA-FITC in the incubation medium plays a major role in the binding capacity of estrogen-receptors (ER). Fluorescence involves cytoplasm and/or the nucleus. The specificity of labelling on control sections by different methods of inhibition is variously appreciated. The threshold of ER-positivity varies from 10 to 90% of the cells. Standardization of the procedure, if possible, is highly desirable as much as the interpretation rules of the results.	1984
6400034	The clinical application of fibroblast interferon--an overview.	Preclinical as well as clinical studies with fibroblast interferon (IFN) are still lagging behind on those with leukocyte interferon. Its side-effects seem to be less pronounced than those of human IFN-alpha, yet it may be slightly pyrogenic after intravenous injection. Pyrogenicity of current impure preparations might for the larger part be due to impurities. Higher doses of HuIFN-beta than of HuIFN-alpha are required to obtain measurable blood titers by intramuscular injections. Since there is concern about this being due to destruction of the interferon before it has reached its target organ(s), most current clinical studies use either local (e.g. intratumoral) treatment or intravenous infusions. A study of topical treatment for acute rhinovirus infection has indicated that there is very little if any chance for fibroblast interferon to be a clinically useful substance to prevent or cure common cold. In herpetic dendritic keratitis eye drops of fibroblast interferon may be useful as such or in combination with debridement. Topical treatment of warts (multiple intralesional injections) has been shown to yield a high success rate, especially in the case of verrucae vulgares, but less so in the case of verrucae planae juveniles. Studies on condyloma accuminatum are not so far advanced as to permit a documented conclusion. Topical (intralesional) treatment of neoplastic diseases has been investigated, especially in Japan, to demonstrate that fibroblast interferon does have an antineoplastic effect in vivo. While there seems to be little doubt that local delivery does indeed cause tumor nodules to regress, the question is whether this procedure can offer a true clinical benefit to the patient. Systemic (intravenous) administration for chronic hepatitis B has been investigated further: given alone or in combination with adenine-arabinoside, fibroblast interferon seems to be able to reduce the level of viral activity. Whether this will lead to a generally accepted treatment of chronic active hepatitis is difficult to say at this moment. In treating herpes zoster in cancer patients, results have been obtained which are comparable to those found for leukocyte interferon. The practical significance of this finding must be seen in the perspective of recent developments in the chemotherapy of herpes zoster. In breast cancer patients given intramuscular injections, metastases in the skin, but not in other organs, showed alterations suggestive of an effect on tumor progression. Yet there was no true clinical benefit for the patient. In other tumors, e.g. head and neck epithelioma, no effect was seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)	1984
6331553	Serum cold agglutinin and IgM levels in breast carcinoma.	Breast carcinoma (BCa) cells produce I antigen or I antigen-like substances that may influence serum anti-I. We determined cold hemagglutinins in 170 BCa patients, 97 women with benign breast disease, and 37 female controls of comparable ages to the patients. The results were expressed as an anti-I score. Serum IgM was measured by radial immunodiffusion. The data for the BCa patients were analyzed by pathologic stage (PS) and histologic category. The anti-I score for PS III (28.1 +/- 13.0; mean +/- S.D.) was higher (p less than 0.02), and that for PS IV (11.4 +/- 7.4) lower (p less than 0.02) than the control value (17.7 +/- 10.2). IgM concentrations of the BCa patients as a group or by PS were similar to those of the controls. The mean anti-I scores were higher in mucinous (31.1 +/- 14.9, p less than 0.001) and apocrine BCa (28.6 +/- 16.2, p less than 0.02) compared to the control value. IgM concentrations were elevated in mucinous (218.1 +/- 85.8 mg/dl, p less than 0.01) and apocrine BCa (241.9 +/- 99.0, p less than 0.005) compared to the control value (157.1 +/- 66.9). The results suggest an association of anti-I scores and PS of BCa and suggest an antigenic difference of mucinous and apocrine from infiltrative ductal BCa.	1984

6850511	Influence of surgical technique on estrogen and progesterone receptor determinations in breast cancer.	The effect of surgical technique on hormone receptor values in breast cancer tissue was examined. One hundred and thirty-one women with breast cancer were divided into three groups: Group I, definitive diagnosis at frozen section and tissue taken for receptor determination; Groups II and III, diagnosis made by aspiration biopsy cytology, with tissue obtained from modified radical mastectomy in Group II and tissue obtained from mastectomy performed separately, prior to axillary lymph node dissection, in Group III. The rates of estrogen and progesterone receptor positivity, and the mean levels of receptor, did not differ significantly among the three groups. Thus tumor tissue from a mastectomy specimen can be reliably used for hormone receptor determinations, if the tumor tissue is kept cold and rapidly frozen for storage. Women whose cancer has been diagnosed by aspiration biopsy cytology need not undergo an additional open biopsy solely to obtain tissue for receptor determinations.	1983
6869823	Radioenzymatic determination of CMP-N-acetylsialic acid and free N-acetylsialic acid in biological material.	Free N-acetylsialic acid (NeuNAc) and CMP-N-acetylsialic acids (CMP-NeuNAc) are extracted from freeze-clamped or liquid nitrogen-frozen biological material by sequential extraction with cold acetone and acetone/water. [14C]NeuNAc and [14C]CMP-NeuNAc (20,000 dpm each) are added to the frozen material to correct for small losses occurring during the subsequent steps. NeuNAc and CMP-NeuNAc are separated by anion-exchange chromatography. CMP-NeuNAc is hydrolyzed with formic acid and again chromatographed on an ion-exchange column. The NeuNAc-containing fractions (representing free NeuNAc and CMP-NeuNAc) are converted to [14C]CMP-NeuNAc in the presence of [14C]CTP and CMP-NeuNAc synthetase. [14C]CMP-NeuNAc is separated by paper chromatography and the radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of NeuNAc is calculated from a calibration curve obtained with NeuNAc standards. The small amounts of [14C]NeuNAc and [14C]CMP-NeuNAc added initially do not interfere with the final assay. The method gives reliable values down to 50 pmol/assay, but the sensitivity can be easily increased by a factor of 10. Recoveries, with NeuNAc and CMP-NeuNAc added to biological extracts, were 98.3 and 98.5% for NeuNAc and CMP-NeuNAc, respectively. With this method values of 61.2 +/- 12.8 and 24.4 +/- 5.2 nmol/g wet wt were found in rat liver for free NeuNAc and CMP-NeuNAc, respectively. Values for free NeuNAc found in human blood plasma were 600 +/- 476 and 373 +/- 180 pmol/g plasma for healthy persons and patients with breast cancer, respectively. Free CMP-NeuNAc could not be found in plasma.	1983
6833509	Oestrogen receptor assay of cryostat sections of human breast carcinomas with simultaneous quantitative histology.	Cryostat sections of unfixed human breast carcinomas were assayed for oestrogen receptor (ER) content using an isoelectric focusing method to separate the receptor-bound oestradiol. Adjacent sections from the same tissue block were stained so that the tumour content could be estimated by point counting and the ER concentration adjusted to compensate for variations in cellularity. Elastosis was also assessed. The results confirm a positive correlation between ER values and both cellularity and elastosis. The measurement of ER in cryostat sections is relatively simple and rapid, is applicable to small tissue samples, and permits histological identification of the nature and composition of the assayed sample. The method is directly applicable to oestrogen receptor analyses of breast carcinomas in clinical laboratories with facilities for cryostat microtomy.	1983

6188586	A detergent-trypsin method for the preparation of nuclei for flow cytometric DNA analysis.	A new modification of our detergent technique for the preparation of nuclei for flow cytometric DNA analysis is described. The attainment of low coefficients of variation of the peaks and of quantitative staining of nuclei from different tissues was a problem with the original method. This was solved in the new modification by trypsinization of the unfixed nuclei. The nuclei were stabilized by spermine. A simple procedure for long-term storage of samples at -80 degrees C was integrated into the method. The fluorescence of the nuclei was stable for at least 3 hours after staining. Light exposure protection of the samples was essential. No cell loss was caused by storage or staining. The method was successfully applied on samples including: (a) Normal tissues--human lymphocytes, granulocytes and spleen. Mouse lymphocytes, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney and thymus. (b) Human neoplasms--lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia, bladder cancer and cancer of the oral cavity. (c) Human tumors in nude mice--breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma and colon cancer. (d) Mouse ascites tumors--JB-1, L 1210, Ehrlich and P 383. It therefore seems well suited as a routine clinical procedure.	1983

7075553	Specific cytotoxicity of 16 alpha-[125I]iodoestradiol for estrogen receptor-containing breast cancer cells.	We attempted to induce specific killing of estrogen receptor-containing breast cancer cells using estradiol coupled to a high specific activity gamma emitting isotope of iodine. MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were incubated with 16 alpha-[125I]iodoestradiol alone ([125I]E2), or with 16 alpha-[125I]iodoestradiol plus 100-fold excess 17 beta-estradiol (E2), and then viably frozen. After 8 weeks, the [125I]E2 exposed cells and the [125 I]E2 plus E2 exposed cells were 10% and 77% of controls, respectively. When the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 which does not contain estrogen receptors was used, the rate of cell death was similar to the competed MCF-7 cells. When specific cytotoxicity was compared using a cloning technique, nearly a 5 log reduction in surviving cell fraction was seen with [125I]E2, as compared to identical cells treated with [125I]E2 plus competitor. This technique shows promise for selecting a population of cells with defects in their estrogen receptor and in studying subcellular hormone interactions.	1982
7090023	The specific binding of estradiol and estrone and the subsequent distribution of estrogen-receptor complexes within MCF-7 human breast cancer cells.	We have examined the specific binding of estradiol (E2) and estrone (E1) within MCF-7 cells using both cytosol and whole cell suspension binding assay techniques. The results of these studies have revealed that each of these estrogens binds the high but different affinity to the same single class of cytosol receptor (ER). The incubation of intact cells with E2 at 37 degrees resulted in the rapid formation, nuclear binding, and nuclear processing of E2-ER complexes. Reduction of incubation temperature to 15 degrees C and 4 degrees C resulted in slowed but continued E2-ER formation and nuclear binding, and in a marked inhibition of nuclear receptor processing. The incubation of intact cells with E1 at 37 degrees also was associated with the formation, nuclear binding, and nuclear processing of estrogen-ER complexes. Interestingly, however, E2 rather the E1 represented the major species of specifically bound estrogen under these conditions. This observation suggests that the estrogenic action of E1 in MCF-7 cells may be mediated largely by the intracellular formation of E2. This phenomenon provides a likely explanation of the unexpected potency of E1 in this system previously observed by other workers. Furthermore, our results suggest that E1 may represent a major source of estrogenic stimulation for some hormone-dependent human breast tumors.	1982

6756514	Autologous bone marrow transplantation in metastatic breast cancer.	The use of adjuvant chemotherapy following the primary treatment of breast cancer has led to an increased disease-free survival. The outlook for patients who present with metastatic disease however remains dismal, with little improvement in survival in the last decade. A recent analysis by Bonadonna and his colleagues has demonstrated a strong influence of the dose of drugs administered on relapse-free survival in patients with breast cancer receiving adjuvant therapy and those with metastatic disease. The utilization of cryopreserved autologous bone marrow permits the use of more aggressive therapy without regard to marrow toxicity, the dose-limiting feature of many antineoplastic agents. Some of the questions and potential problems with the use of autologous marrow rescue in solid tumors is discussed. Preliminary data on a protocol to evaluate the role of high-dose cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation with autologous marrow transplantation in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma are presented.	1982
6293199	Red blood cell cold agglutinins and B lymphocyte cytotoxins in breast cancer sera.	Cytotoxic activity towards B-lymphocytes in sera from individuals with breast carcinoma was related to red blood cell cold agglutinin levels and IgM values. The control group consisted of 32 females with a similar age distribution. Significant increases in red blood cell cold agglutinin levels were found in the group of cancer patients and the group with the histological category of mucin-producing carcinoma with lymphocyte cytotoxins (p less than 0.025, respectively), in comparison to the control group and cancer patients without lymphocyte cytotoxins. Serum IgM concentrations were significantly increased in the group of cancer patients (p less than 0.025) and the group with mucin-producing carcinoma (p less than 0.01) with lymphocyte cytotoxins, in comparison to cancer patients and controls without lymphocyte cytotoxins. The lymphocyte cytotoxins were completely or partially adsorbed by red blood cells in 58% of the positive sera. These results suggest that red blood cell cold agglutinins constitute a portion of cytotoxic anti-B lymphocyte antibodies. At present it is unknown whether the lymphocytotoxic antibodies in breast cancer patients are of importance in immunologic host defenses.	1982

6912893	Need priorities of adrenalectomy patients as perceived by patients, nurses, and physicians.	Patients in this study identified needs they considered important. Perceived need priorities of adrenalectomy patients need to be identified and met both pre- and postoperatively by health team members. Patient-centered nursing and medical conferences should be arranged to provide comprehensive patient care. Establishment of guidelines, based on need priorities perceived by the patient, will provide a master care plan which can assist nurses and physicians in meeting patient needs. These guidelines are important since patients need not only an immediate care plan, but also a long-term plan of care designed to meet individual needs and ever-changing problems of the long-term illness. The study findings show that patients, nurses, and physicians differ in their perception of need priorities of adrenalectomy patients. Nurses and physicians must take heed of patient concerns. Nurses, especially, must realize the needs of the patient in order to provide support, counseling, and education. The necessity for total awareness of patients' needs and perceptions is illustrated by one cancer patient's comments: "Although the disease was diagnosed early and responded successfully to treatment, there was a numbness and fear, the cold chills that accompanied the awareness of the diagnosis and later the altered perception of life, of friends and associates that grew out of the realization that death was never far away. "A human organism with a malignant neoplasm is more than a body with a disease. It is also a reacting individual who has feelings about his illness, and these feelings influence the way he perceives his medical personnel and utilizes his advice and care." It is important that all members of the health team acquire a better understanding of the various need theories and the importance of perceiving the needs of patients as the patient perceives them. In addition, it is essential for health team members to continually refer to the relevant literature concerning needs to improve the quality of total patient-family care.
6173035	Evidence for two forms of reverse transcriptase in human placenta of a patient with breast cancer. Purification and biochemical characterization of the enzymes.	Two DNA polymerases with properties of viral RNA-directed DNA polymerase were found in the placenta of a patient with breast cancer. Both enzyme activities were purified by column-chromatographic procedures or by preparative isoelectric focusing. The most distinguishing feature of the two enzymes is their specificity to transcribe (rA)n . (dT)12 or (rC)n . (dG)18. The two enzymes differ with respect to their elution profiles from the phosphocellulose column, isoelectric point, molecular weight, bivalent-cation requirements and thermal stability. Serological analysis of the (rA)n . (dT)12-activated enzyme showed that this enzyme is immunologically not related to DNA polymerase-gamma, or to any of the reverse transcriptases purified from retroviruses of avian, murine and subprimate origin. However, the activity of this enzyme was neutralized by antibodies to reverse transcriptase purified from human spleen of a patient with myelofibrosis [Chandra & Steel (1977) Biochem. J. 167, 513-524]. Attempts to purify reverse transcriptase of normal human placenta were repeatedly unsuccessful. Once the crude homogenate of normal placenta was freed from endogenous nucleic acids, no (rC)n . (dG)18-dependent activity cold be detected.U	1981
7195411	Lysis of human solid tumors by autologous cells sensitized in vitro to alloantigens.	Human lymphocytes sensitized in vitro to allogeneic single-donor cells as well as to pools of allogeneic donor cells were evaluated for their cytotoxic potential against autologous fresh solid tumor cells, autologous tissue-cultured tumor and fibroblasts, fresh peripheral blood lymphoid cells (PBL), and Con A blasts of PBL. Using 4-hr 51Cr release assays, pool-sensitized effector cells lysed autologous tissue-cultured tumor and fibroblast targets in 4 of 4 experiments. Similarly, in 2 of 2 experiments with single-donor allosensitized effectors, autologous tissue-cultured tumor was lysed. No lysis of fresh PBL was seen. Significant lysis of fresh autologous tumor target cells was seen in 10 of 12 experiments with pool-sensitized effectors, though, again, no lysis of autologous PBL was observed. No lysis of autologous Con A blasts was seen in 2 of 2 experiments. Fresh tumor cells, PBL, and Con A blasts appeared equally lysable, since they were equally lysed by effector cells specifically sensitized to alloantigens present on these cells. Cold target inhibition studies demonstrated that cultured tumor and fibroblasts but not PBL shared the determinants recognized by pool-sensitized cells.	1981
7008580	The surgical pathologist as a diagnostician and consultant.	The primary role of the surgical pathologist is to diagnose, and then to transmit this information effectively so that it can be used to guide patient management; therefore, the dual roles of the surgical pathologist as a diagnostician and consultant are inextricable. The diagnostic pathologist determines the nature, extent, and rate of disease processes as well as response to therapy or the effects of medication, on the basis of morphologic observations. This presentation reviews some historic aspects of the evolution of surgical pathology, and its projected status in the medical community. The paradoxical (mis)concept of the pathologist with his microscope and slide, in vacuo, devoid of pertinent clinical data, as a pristine expression of objectivity is discusses and compared with the real world in which veracity is a proper surrogate for blind objectivity. The molding of the scientific method with the art of clinical practice by the pathologist is also considered.	1981
7349789	Cancer risk, age at diagnosis, and age at death as functions of season of birth.	The Third National Cancer Survey (TNSC) includes more than 90,000 patients who died during the study period. Their lifespan varies with their season of birth. Patients born in the winter became in average 1.5 years older than patients born in the summer. This difference is very significant. The variation agrees with the results from a similar study performed about 50 years ago which used genealogical data. The season of birth distributions are equal for males and females, slightly different for blacks and whites and different for colon, rectum, breast cancer patients compared to stomach and lung cancer patients. There are significant regional difference with greater variation in season of birth for patients residing in hot areas than for patients residing in cold areas. It is assumed that the observed phenomena are related to health in general and not to cancer in particular.	1981
6795872	Autologous nonfrozen bone marrow transplantation after intensive chemotherapy: a pilot study.	15 patients with metastatic, nonhematopoietic neoplasms refractory to conventional means of treatment were given intensive chemotherapy followed by infusion of autologous noncryopreserved bone marrow which had been stored at 10 degrees C. This study has shown that the procurement of bone marrow from patients with advanced disease and reinfusion 12 h after high dose chemotherapy is tolerated without significant patient morbidity. The use of marrow stored at 10 degrees C leads to adequate recovery of granulocyte stem cells. The present data also suggest that autologous bone marrow transplantation is beneficial in shortening hematopoietic recovery time in patients receiving high dose chemotherapy and may improve response rates in patients with refractory neoplasms.	1981
6779558	Diagnostic oncology case study: lytic spine lesion and cold bone scan.	In summary, when photon-deficient lesions are demonstrated on bone scans of patients in the cancer age group, metastatic disease should be the first consideration. This is especially true in the presence of a lytic bone lesion. Bronchogenic and breast carcinomas are the most common primaries. A negative physical examination and normal CEA levels do not exclude the possibility of metastatic breast cancer.	1981
6967746	Studies on levamisole--induced agranulocytosis.	Widespread clinical trials of leavo-tetramisole (levamisole) as an immunopotentiating agent in rheumatoid arthritis, metastatic carcinoma, and immunodeficiency states have been complicated by agranulocytosis (AGC) in 2.5%-13% of patients. Other than a relationship with prolonged high dosage, very little is known regarding the pathogenesis of levamisole-induced AGC. Whereas leukoagglutination was negative, fluorochromatic microgranulocytotoxicity (GCY) tests were positive with serum from 10 of 10 acutely neutropenic patients. The antibody was IgM, reacted with 100% of unrelated granulocytes, but not with T or B lymphocytes. Some sera also reacted with monocytes and the myeloid cell line, K-562. Tests for antigen-antibody complexes or cold autoantibodies were negative. Although clinical evidence strongly suggests a haptene (drug) mechanism, in vitro mixing experiments were also negative. An alternative choice parallels the model of aldomet-induced Coombs'-positive hemolytic anemia. Finally, GCY first became positive 2-3 mo prior to the onset of AGC on two patients, suggesting the possibility of identifying those at risk well before the onset of neutropenia.	1980
7397671	Thermography and ultrasound in detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.	Although thermography has not proven to be of significant value in detecting early breast cancer as used in the National Breast Cancer Detection Program, it can represent a high risk indicator and can be useful in combination with other factors in reducing the number of women who should receive routine mammograms for screening purposes. In breast cancer patients, thermography has been shown to have prognostic value. "Cold" breast cancers have an increased survival as compared to those with increased infrared emission in some series. The use of diagnostic ultrasound to date has been generally limited to evaluation of breast cancer or masses found by either palpation or mammography. Recent improvements in technology with the use of multiple transducers, higher frequencies, through-transmission techniques, and computerization have resulted in finding lesions greater than one centimeter in diameter. Lesions below this size and small calcifications have not so far been generally demonstrated successfully because of the limitation of ultrasound resolution.	1980
6248193	The histopathological evaluation of human breast cancers in correlation with estrogen receptor values.	A detailed histopathological review of 140 primary breast cancers analyzed for estrogen receptor protein (ERP) was carried out and a variety of morphological features correlated with ERP results. ERP in cytosols was incubated with [3H]estradiol in the presence and absence of cold estradiol and assayed by agargel electrophoresis. Tumors binding greater than 10 fmol estradiol/mg tissue protein were classified as receptor-positive. Seventy-seven percent of the 116 infiltrating duct carcinomas were ERP-positive. The well-differentiated tumors of this group had a higher incidence of ERP-positivity than the poorly differentiated ones. The ten predominantly or exclusively intraductal carcinomas and the seven medullary tumors were less frequently positive than the main group of infiltrating ductal cancers. The three colloid, two tubular, and two lobular carcinomas in this series were all ERP-positive. When receptor measurements are evaluated, consideration should be given to the degree of differentiation and the histological type of tumor, in addition to other factors known to influence receptor levels such as menopausal status and seasonal variation.	1980

7361713	Estrogen receptor protein. Stability of 8S molecular form in frozen cytosols and practical criteria for its confirmation.	Estrogen receptor has been used in determining the efficacy of endocrine therapy in mammary tumors. Complete study of a tumor usually requires two procedures, a dextran-coated charcoal method for measuring binding capacity and binding affinity and a sucrose density procedure for confirmation of 8S protein, both of which are time consuming and expensive. A stability study of the 8S and 4S molecular forms in frozen cytosols at 24 hours, 48 hours, and one week was conducted. Some loss of these, forms after storage was evident, but in all cytosols studied, the two distinct forms could still be identified. Using a group of 100 tumor samples analyzed by both methods, practical criteria for determining when the 8S molecular form should be confirmed by a sucrose density gradient on the frozen cytosol have been formulated.	1980
7197689	Influence of tissue homogenization techniques on levels of estrogen and progesterone receptors measured in calf uterus and human breast tumors.	We have investigated the solubilization of estrogen and progesterone receptors during homogenization of human breast tumor and calf uterus tissue. With chopped human breast tumor tissue, the maximum yield of binding proteins occurred after mechanical homogenization at 4 degrees C with a polytron PT-10 instrument running at setting 5 for 10-15 seconds. With frozen or lyophilised tissue powders the maximum yield of binding proteins occurred after intermittent vortex mixing with buffer over 60 min. at 4 degrees C. The solubilized receptor proteins were stable for at least 150 min. at 4 degrees C. Mechanical homogenization of the tissue powder suspensions resulted in rapid denaturation of the receptors. No improvement in stability was obtained by including 10 mM monothioglycerol and 10% glycerol in the homogenization buffer.	1980

263113	Thyroid and associated polyglandular neoplasms in patients who received head and neck irradiation during childhood.	One hundred fifty-one patients with a history of childhood irradiation to the head, neck, and thorax had neck explorations (142 for "cold" thyroid nodules and 9 for hypercalcemia). Fifty-nine of the patients had thyroid carcinoma, and associated glandular tumors were found in 20 others. In addition, 6 female patients developed breast carcinoma; 4 of these women also had thyroid carcinoma. In this series, 48.6% of the patients irradiated for acne and 36.4% with tonsil and adenoid irradiation developed thyroid carcinoma, but only 10.5% with thymic irradiation did so. It is suggested that the workup on these patients include not only complete thyroid and parathyroid testing, but also a careful examination of all salivary glands, both major and minor. Women should have thorough breast examinations and should perhaps be followed as if they were in the potentially high-risk breast group. When thyroid surgery is performed, a total thyroidectomy is recommended.
427754	Stability of estrogen receptors in frozen human breast tumor tissue.	The effect of freezing on the stability of the estrogen receptors in human breast tumors was measured. Portions of three tumors kept frozen for 3 days after removal from the patients were analyzed by the sucrose density gradient method. The initial measurements demonstrated positive receptor values. The remaining portions were kept frozen for 30 days, and the receptor values were reevaluated. The 8S receptor was 80% destroyed under these freezing conditions. The 4S receptor was found to be more stable. The inactivation reflects a loss of specific binding since the protein concentration was similar in the analyses. These results strongly indicate that human breast tumor specimens should be analyzed as soon as possible or within 3 weeks after freezing.	1979
553583	[Measurement of cytoplasmic receptors specific for steroid hormones. IV) Glucocorticoid receptor].	Binding of 3H-cortisol (3H-C) and 3H-dexamethasone (3H-DX), a fluorinated glucocorticoid which does not bind to Corticosteroid Binding Globulin (CBG), was investigated in two different target tissues, human breast cancer and human leukemic lymphocytes, using a modified DCC assay method. Maximal binding to cytosol occurred, when increasing concentrations of 3H-C or 3H-DX were incubated in the presence or in the absence of an excess of cold cortisol or dexamethasone, at 0 degrees C for 1 hr or 4 hr, respectively. A 50 sec exposure to DCC was sufficient to separate bound from free labelled steroid. Data presented suggest that two different classes of glucocorticoid exist, which are differently distributed in target tissues, and may be identified on the basis of affinity for the tracer, binding specificity and thermolability.	1979
156971	Aromatization of androgens by human breast cancer.	The metabolism of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone by human mammary tumor was investigated. Estrogen synthesis from dehydroepiandrosterone was observed in 9 of 10 estrogen-receptor-negative tumors and only in 2 of 8 receptor-positive tumors (p less than 0.025). Conversion of testosterone to estrogens was observed in 7 of 8 receptor-negative and 2 of 7 receptor-positive tumors. Tumors which are capable of transforming dehydroepiandrosterone to estrogens were also able to aromatize testosterone suggesting that the presence of the aromatase enzyme is inherent to certain tumor cells. No estrogen formation was detected by the mitochondrial-microsomal fraction of normal breast cells while fractions from both fat cell and tumor cell showed estrogen synthesis. Estrogen formation by tumor cell fraction ranged from 5 to 190 times that observed for fat cells. The physiological significance of these results in the neoplastic tissue and its relationship to hormone dependence are discussed.	1979

Experience shows a significantly higher incidence of positive tests on specimens transported by this means than on specimens transported in dry ice.	1978

743554	Routine analysis of multiple steroid receptors in human breast cancer.--I--Technological features.	The technological features of multiple and simultaneous assays of steroid receptors (estrogen and progestagens) have been considered in human mammary carcinomas. Most of the parameters involved in the accuracy and the fiability of S-R determination have been investigated : the stability of S-R proteins (collection and storage of sample, cytosol preparation and buffer components, endogenous steroid problem), the specificity and precise quantitation of the binding (conditions of incubations, use of steroid analogs, dextran-coated charcoal method and treatment of binding data by the Scatchard analysis), the identification of the binding (vertical sucrose density gradients) and the interferences in DCC assays. The routinely adopted protocol has been experienced in 650 cases of S-R assay. It is concluded that when performed under appropriate and properly controlled conditions and even in a small sample, multiple S-R assay could result in a precise quantitation and identification of the pathological state of the S-R system in a tumor at time of surgery. Considered with regards to actual knowledges in cell biology, that is of importance and could provide even more information about therapeutic guidance.	1978
707434	Estrogen receptor assay of carcinomas of the breast by a simplified dextran--charcoal method.	Carcinomas of the breast from 352 women were assayed for binding of tritiated estradiol by tumor cytosol with dextran--charcoal adsorption, saturation analysis, and two-point Scatchard plots; the level of saturable binding defined a cytosol as positive or negative for estrogen receptor. Valid assays were obtained on specimens as small as 120 mg. Assays of replicate samples of a cytosol were more reproducible than assays of replicate samples of the tumor itself. Occasional disparity of results between a primary mammary carcinoma and its axillary metastases could be related to differences in tumor cellularity. Saturable binding consistent with the presence of estrogen receptor was found in 59% of 305 primary carcinomas and in 57% of 47 metastatic or recurrent carcinomas. There was a significant negative correlation between the patient's age and saturable estrogen binding in the tumor. Serum estradiol levels of less than 250 pg/ml appeared to have a negligible effect on estrogen receptor content. A small subgroup of high-binding carcinomas had high dissociation constants, but the significance of this observation is not clear.	1978

101298	Cryopathic gangrene with an IgM lambda cryoprecipitating cold agglutinin.	Immunochemical and serologic studies of cold agglutinis in patients with chronic cold agglutinin disease (CCAD) have shown the almost exclusive occurrence of IgM kappa antibodies with specificity for the I antigen of red cells. An unusual subgroup of patients has been delineated in which the cryoprotein is IgM lambda, frequently lacks I specificity and often cryoprecipitates. Studies of such a protein from a patient with an unusual array of immunoproliferative disorders including Grave's disease with exophthalmos and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia indicate that the cryoprecipitating and cold agglutinating properties probably derive from the sam protein. The occurrence of this type of antibody should suggest the presence of a more aggressive lymphoproliferative disorder than simple CCAD.	1978

Colony-forming epithelial cells can be separated from the non-dividing "foam cells" in human milk by differential adhesion to glass and freezing.

Foam cells, mitomycin-treated mouse fibroblast lines and human mammary fibroblasts and calf lens epithelial cells are all effective in promoting mammary epithelial cell growth. Contact between epithelial cells and feeders is not required for the growth-promoting effect. The mitogenic effect of epidermal growth factor on mammary epithelial cells also requires feeder cell activity.	1977

Experimental evidence is presented that supports the use of the cold agar-gel electrophoretic method for the clinical quantitation of specific estrogen-binding protein present in some human mammary carcinomas. It is necessary to dilute tumor extracts to avoid interference by serum-borne, non-relevant hormone-binding proteins such as albumin, which migrates to the same anodal region as does the binding protein. Dilution to 2.5 mg or less of total protein per milliliter circumvents such interference while still permitting reliable quantitation of the binding protein. Seventy-two mammary carcinomas were compared for binding-protein content by both the cold agar-gel electrophoresis and a single-point dextran-coated charcoal assay. The correlation coefficient (0.96) indicated excellent agreement between results by the two methods. In addition results are presented which indicate that the preparation of tumor extracts for electrophoresis does not require the use of an ultracentrifuge.	1977

836153	Freezing and storage of breast cancer tissue for estrogen receptor protein assay: a convenient method.	Sixteen patients underwent biopsy of primary or metastatic breast cancer and had equal portions of the tumors rapidly frozen by either the use of liquid nitrogen or the fluorinated hydrocarbon spray, Cryokwik. The estrogen receptor protein (ERP) assay was then performed on both specimens, utilizing the surcose gradient density method. In general, both methods of freezing gave similar results. Three patients had ERP measured after approximately three to four months of storage at -70 C. After a minimum of 14 weeks' storage, there was no statistically significant loss of activity by either method of preparation. The Cryokwik preparation method makes the accurate measurement of ERP possible for all community hospitals. The tissue may be prepared and stored until a convenient time for transportation to the appropriate laboratory.	1977
973666	Cancer in the "cold" breast thermogram.	The hallmark of the normal breast thermogram is relative symmetry of vascular configuration and thermal content with preservation of the breast contour. Accepted criteria of abnormality are predicated upon graphic and thermal asymmetry with emphasis placed upon elevated temperature, an increase in the number of discernible vessels, and distorted vascular patterns. The association of a confirmed breast cancer and an avascular thermogram has been labeled a false negative. Avascularity ("cold" breast), particularly in the lower half, with normal vessels in the same location of the opposite breast is suggested as an additional characteristic of abnormality. Illustrative cases are presented.	1976

172954	Focal decreased skeletal uptake secondary to metastatic disease.	Two cases are reported in which bone imaging with 99mTc-labeled phosphate compounds revealed localized areas of decreased uptake corresponding to osteolytic metastases on bone radiographs. These "cold" bone lesions, although infrequent, should be considered to avoid false negative interpretations.	1976

1185258	"Cold" lesions on bone imaging.	Photon-deficient foci or "cold" lesions were demonstrated on 99mTc-polyphosphate bone imaging in eight individuals with various malignancies and one in sickle cell crisis. The bone radiographs of five of these persons failed to show corresponding bony changes at the time of the imaging. Most of the "cold" lesions observed on bone imaging were located in the denser and tubular bones. A postulate has been advanced regarding the factors that might influence the different gamma-imaging manifestations of radiographically demonstrable lytic lesions. The cases presented herein further emphasize the importance of recognizing the existence of "cold" areas in the images of bones and the need to place these in proper perspective when interpreting scans.	1975
171066	Pathological review of breast lesions analyzed for estrogen receptor protein.	This report provides a detailed pathological review of 333 specimens analyzed for estrogen receptor protein (ERP) and correlates a series of morphological features with ERP results. Included were 147 primary breast carcinomas, 78 metastases, 27 fibroadenomas, and 81 nonneoplastic tissues, all from women. ERP in cytosols was assayed by incubation with [3H]estradiol in the presence and absence of "cold" estradiol followed by dextran-charcoal treatment. Results were summarized as positive (greater 60% inhibition by nontritiated estradiol, greater than 10 fmoles/mg protein), negative (less than 60% inhibition by nontritiated estradiol, less than 10 fmoles/mg protein), or intermediate borderline combinations. ERP in primary tumors ranged from 0.2 to 358 fmoles/mg protein (54.4% positive, 35.4% negative, 10.2% borderline). New findings are: (a) a high frequency of positive ERP in invasive lobular carcinoma (12 of 13, 92.3%) compared to typical ductal tumors (64 of 117, 54.7%); and (b) low frequency of positive ERP(5 of 21, 23.8%) in tumors with a prominent local lymphocyte reaction. Three ERP-positive noncarcinomatous specimens were fibroadenomas of high epithelial cellularity from patients under 30 years. No statistically significant relationship existed between ERP and any other morphological features that were examined.	1975
1084128	[Cold lymphocytotoxins: their relationship with various physiological and pathological conditions].	The significance of cold lymphocytotoxins, observed at 15 degreesC, is not clearly understood at the present time. The frequency of their appearance has been studied in normal subjects (blood donors, aged people, vaccinated subjects, post-traumatic splenectomy) and in patients with a neurologic disease (multiple sclerosis), a neoplasic disease (breast cancer)and hematologic diseases (thrombocytopenia, acute leukemia, chronic lymphatic leukemia, Hodgkin disease and systemic lupus erythematosus). There are no antibodies found in the geriatric group; they are found only in 3,9 % of blood donors and in 18 % of the subjects after vaccinations. A range of 17 to 30 % is found in subjects with breast cancer or multiple sclerosis. More than 50 % of the individuals with Hodgkin disease or lupus erythematosus produce these antibodies (52 % and 73 % respectively). In acute leukemias and chronic lymphatic leukemias, lymphocytotoxic antibodies sometimes appear at 37 degrees, reacting with autologous cells and having no HL-A specificity.
1174390	Elevation of serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) level in patients with brain tumors.	Sera of 43 brain tumor patients were analyzed along with various other control groups for serum immunoglobulin, cold and sheep cell hemagglutinin and a heterophile type antibody. Serum IgM and heterophile antibody (non-Forssman type) were found elevated in brain tumor and various acute viral meningoencephalitis groups. Serum IgA and IgG levels were essentially unchanged. IgM levels appear to be particularly stimulated by the meningioma class because the removal of tumor from the host was accompanied by its return to normal range. This system of IgM measurement may prove to be a valuable tool in preliminary diagnosis of brain tumors.	1975

1118621	Thermal evaluation of breast disease using local cooling.	A simple, inexpensive local cooling system for thermal evaluation of breast disease is described. Skin temperature measured during a 10-minute cooling process averaged 1.2degrees C higher over 31 proved cancers and 0.6degrees C lower over 18 benign masses. Forty-nine masses averaged 1.7 cm in diameter and were 1.5 cm deep; 23 of 31 malignancies (74%), 16 of 18 benign growths (88%), and 46 of 52 "normals" (88%) would have been correctly diagnosed, while results for 10 of 22 women (45%) with asymmetrical diffuse non-malignant disease would have been falsely classified positive.	1975
234975	Aromatization of androgens by human abdominal and breast fat tissue.	The ability of human abdominal, breast and axillary fat to convert androgens into estrogens was investigated by incubating labeled substrates in the presence of NADPH with a variety of cell preparations. The incubation products were subjected to phenolic partition, paper chromatography, methyl-ether formation, repeat chromatography and crystallization with cold carrier reference standards to constant specific activity. Androstenedione was converted to estrone and, to a lesser extent, to 17beta-estradiol by crude homogenates, minces, fat-free particulate fractions (1,000-100,000 time g) and isolated fat cells obtained from abdominal, breast or axillary fat. Testosterone was found to be aromatized as actively as androstenedione, but inthis case more 17 beta-estrodiol was formed than estrone. 19-Hydroxyandrostenedione-2 also served as substrate, givingresults similar to those obtained with androstenedione. Fat tissue obtained from cancerous breasts was found to be as active as normal breast fat (1-4 pg/g fat/90 min) and within the range found for abdominal fat (1-27 pg/g fat/90 min). In each case in which axillary fat was compared to breast fat from the same subject, the activity of the axillary fat was 5 to 10 times higher. The results indicate a possible role of adipose tissue as a significant extra-gonadal source of estrogens.	1975

17474649	[Dynamic telethermography in mammary carcinoma].	Dynamic telethermography, a still new technique, enables to obtain original data on the behaviour of mammary carcinomas both in space and time. It deserves to be used in conjunction with the other clinical and paraclinical methods in the "non bloody combined diagnosis" of such tumors. In spite of 5 per cent of false positive and 8 to 16 per cent false negative results, it helps to correct over one half of erroneous radioclinical diagnosis. It often brings accurate data on extension, multifocality and topography of these carcinomas and plays an efficient part in post-therapeutical systematic periodical surveillance, more especially when the breast has been preserved. Capable of detecting small non-palpable adenocarcinomas, it could be used as a thuthworthy screening procedure. Finally, it demonstrates "cold" cancers and too "hot" cancers, the former of probably slow development, the latter developing rapidly. Beyond a simple positive diagnosis, it is contributory to the first steps of clinical physiology of breast carcinomas, which is all the more remarkable because it is a true non-traumatic tele-measurement.	1973

4573790	A comparison of rapid methods including imprint cytodiagnosis for the diagnosis of breast tumours.	Rapid diagnoses were made on 510 breast lumps by three methods in sequence and the results compared with those obtained by paraffin histology.Naked-eye examination of the excised lumps correctly distinguished between benign and malignant tumours in 95.1% of cases with 23 (4.5%) false negative and two (0.4%) false positive results.Rapid imprint cytodiagnosis was correct in 96.9% of the 391 lumps imprinted with 12 (3.1%) false negatives and no false positive results. Frozen sections gave the correct diagnosis in 99.4% of the 510 cases with three (0.6%) false negative and no false positive results. The use of cytology in the diagnosis of breast tumours is discussed.	1973
